<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

<p class="center">INTRODUCTION</p>


<p>The journey of which an account is given in
the following pages was not undertaken in the
special interests of geographical or other science
nor in the service of any Government. My chief
object was to gratify a long-felt desire to visit
those portions of the Chinese Empire which are
least known to Europeans, and to acquire some
knowledge of the various tribes subject to China
that inhabit the wild regions of Chinese Tibet
and north-western Yunnan. Though nearly every
part of the Eighteen Provinces has in recent years
been visited and described by European travellers,
my route between Tachienlu and Li-chiang was
one which&mdash;so far as I am aware&mdash;no British
subject had ever traversed before me, and of
which no description in book-form has hitherto
appeared in any European language.</p>

<p>From the ethnological point of view the Chinese
Far West&mdash;to which the greater part of this book
is devoted&mdash;is one of the most interesting regions
in the world, and presents problems the solution
of which would settle many of the vexed questions
relating to the origin and inter-relations of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
Asiatic peoples. As for its geographical interest,
it may be sufficient to say here that the principalities
of Chala and Muli contain what are
probably the highest spots inhabited by man on
the face of the globe, and that several of the
passes crossed by my little caravan are loftier than
the highest of the passes existing along the route
traversed by the British expedition to Lhasa. My
own contributions to geographical and ethnological
lore are of the slenderest; but if I can persuade
some of my readers that Tibetan Ssuch'uan and
western Yunnan are worth visiting, be it only for
the glory of their mountain scenery, I shall consider
that my book has fulfilled the most useful
purpose to which it aspires.</p>

<p>For those who are seized by a craving to revert
for a time to something like the nomadic life of
our remote forefathers, or to pass like the old
Hindu ascetics into "the homeless state," there
can be no country in the world more full of charm
than some of the wilder and less-peopled regions
of the Chinese Empire. There are enormous areas
in that country covered with primeval forests in
which man's foot has never trod, lofty mountains
whose peaks are crowned with sparkling diadems
of eternal snow, grand and savage gorges in which
Nature has carved for herself in indelible letters
the story of the world's youth, and gloomy chasms
through which rush the mighty rivers that carry
to the Indian Ocean and the Pacific snows that
melted on the white roof of the world. And
amid all this magnificence and desolation there
are lovely valleys and stretches of garden-land<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
that might have been chosen as the Edens of a
hundred mythologies, and which in historic times
have been the homes of religious recluses and
poets, who, like others of their kind in Western
lands, found in silence and solitude a refuge
from the bitterness and pain of the world, or
a hermitage in which, amid scenes of perennial
beauty, they could weave their flowers of thought
into immortal garlands of human words.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LOVE OF NATURE IN CHINA</div>

<p>It is a mistake to regard the Chinese as
essentially a prosaic race, caring only for material
things and nothing at all for what we should
call things of the spirit. If they have less power
of artistic creation than the Japanese&mdash;and even
that may be doubted&mdash;they are quite as sensitive
as the people of any other race to the magic of
beauty in either nature or art; and especially do
they&mdash;like our own Ruskin&mdash;take a vivid delight
in the loveliness of mountain scenery. There
is a well-known story of a Chinese scholar who,
like the scholars of most lands, was blest with
few of this world's goods, and, unlike a great
many of them, was noted for his zealous devotion
to the service of his country's gods. One night
he heard the voice of an invisible being that
spoke to him thus: "Your piety has found favour
in the sight of heaven; ask now for what you
most long to possess, for I am the messenger
of the gods, and they have sworn to grant your
heart's desire." "I ask" said the poor scholar
"for the coarsest clothes and food, just enough
for my daily wants, and I beg that I may have
freedom to wander at my will over mountain and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
fell and woodland stream, free from all worldly
cares, till my life's end. That is all I ask."
Hardly had he spoken when the sky seemed to
be filled with the laughter of myriads of unearthly
voices. "All you ask?" cried the messenger of
the gods. "Know you not that what you

<div class="sidenote">ISOLATION</div>

<p>it must be a bitter reflection that man is by his
own works dooming himself to lose for evermore
the privilege of freedom and the solace of
isolation. When an authoritative voice informs us,
in connection with wireless telegraphy, that "our
ultimate ideal must be instantaneous electrical
communication with every man on earth, ashore
or afloat, at a cost within the reach of every
one," what becomes of the unhappy man who
finds one of the greatest joys of travel in the
very fact of his utter loneliness, and in the
knowledge that he is for the time being severed
from all possibility of communication with his
civilised fellow-men? The writer I have just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
quoted<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> assures us that owing to the recent
triumphs of science "a severance of communication
with any part of the earth&mdash;even
the Antipodes&mdash;will henceforth be impossible.
Storms that overthrow telegraph posts, and
malice that cuts our cables, are impotent in
the all-pervading ether. An explorer like Stanley
in the tropical forest, or Geary amid ice-fields,
will report daily progress in the <cite>Times</cite>.... Sir
William Preece's dream of signalling to Mars
may (say by utilising Niagara for the experiment)
yet be realised." Thus even a flight to the virgin
continents of another planet will not give the
future traveller the delicious sense of freedom
that comes from the knowledge of complete
isolation or of entire severance from the cares of
civilised life. How can we expect our mistress
Nature to be gracious to us if we, with our
unholy inventions, woo her so much more rudely
and roughly than did her lovers of the golden
time when the earth was young? For my own
part I rejoice that a wireless-telegraphy apparatus
has not yet become an indispensable item in
every traveller's equipment, and that no law has
yet been enacted penalising any individual who
presumes to sever himself from communication
with his fellows.</p>

<p>If it appears churlish and ungrateful to speak
of the pleasures of separation from all those
comforts and delights that Western civilisation
has placed within our grasp, and without which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
the normal European would hardly find life worth
living, it is only fair to remember that no one
is in a position to appreciate such comforts and
delights so heartily as the man who has been
temporarily deprived of them; though the depth
of his appreciation will, of course, vary according
to the extent of his dependence on the amenities
of civilised life during his ordinary existence as
a social unit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TRAVELS IN THE FAR EAST</div>

<p>The journey described in this book was not
the first undertaken by me in the countries of
the Far East. Towards the close of 1902 I
travelled through the French province of Tongking
(erstwhile tributary to the Chinese Empire)
and ascended the Red River to the high plateau
of Yunnan. After traversing that province from
east to west I reached the town of Ssumao, and
thence struck southwards into the Chinese Shan
States and the French Protected States of Upper
Laos. A journey of many days in a dug-out
canoe down one of the most beautiful rivers of
that country gave me a delightful opportunity of
becoming acquainted with the domestic life of
the Lao-Shans&mdash;surely among the most attractive
and hospitable races in the world. Leaving my
canoe at the charming little Laos capital, Luang
Prabang, I proceeded down the Mekong on a raft
and visited the ruins of the obliterated kingdom
of Vien-chan. There I left the Mekong and
wandered overland through the great dry plain
of eastern Siam to Korat. From Korat I was
speedily conveyed by the prosaic means of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
railway to the perplexing city of Bangkok, with
its curious medley of East and West, old and
new, its electric trams, its royal white elephants, its
gilded pagodas and State umbrellas, and its forlorn
collection of European legations. Except for the
baggage-coolies hired at intervals along my route,
I was for the greater part of this four months'
journey unaccompanied by friend or servant. At
one point, indeed, I was literally alone: for in
the country of the Lao-Shans my four baggage-coolies,
owing to some unreasonable dread of
perfectly non-existent dangers, suddenly left me
to my own devices, and returned to their homes,
obliging me to abandon all my baggage except
what I was able to carry in my own hands and
pockets. It was then that my eyes were first
opened to the fact that civilised man encumbers
himself with a great many material possessions
which he could quite well do without; for at no
time did I suffer the least inconvenience from the
loss of any of the articles which up to that point
I had considered absolutely essential to my comfort
and well-being. Servants and heavy baggage can
indeed easily be dispensed with in any tropical
country in which the natives are not unfriendly,
and provided that the traveller is willing to subsist
entirely on such food as the country affords; and
it is undoubtedly the case that a traveller with
few <i lang="la">impedimenta</i> can penetrate with ease into
remote places that are inaccessible to one whose
train includes numerous coolies and beasts of
burden. One who is travelling with some
definite scientific object in view must, of course,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
carry a suitable equipment of scientific instruments,
and may require a retinue of servants and
surveyors; but it is the mere wanderer&mdash;especially
he who wanders in search of things strange
and beautiful&mdash;not the scientific explorer, whose
requirements I am here considering. It is perhaps
unwise to render oneself absolutely dependent
for supplies on the friendliness of natives, but in
my own case it so happens that I have never
met with inhospitable treatment from any of the
Asiatic peoples among whom I have travelled,
whether Chinese, Tongkingese, Tibetans, Shans,
Siamese, or Burmese. I leave it to others who
have had different experiences to tell their own
tales.</p>

<p>At other times during my residence in China I
have found opportunities to make tours, either in
connection with official business or on leave of
absence, in other parts of the Far East. In China
I have made several excursions into the interior
of the provinces of Kwangtung, Kwangsi, Kiangsi,
and Shantung. In 1904 I travelled through the
German colony of Kiaochou and the provincial
capital, Chinan-fu, on my way to the little town
of Ch'ü Fou, where I visited the tomb of Confucius
and was entertained by the Duke K'ung, said
to be the seventy-sixth descendant of the great
sage in a direct line; and on the same occasion
I ascended the famous sacred mountain of T'ai
Shan, where the Emperor Shun is said to have
sacrificed to heaven in the third millennium <small>B.C.</small>
At the close of the same year, while the Russo-Japanese
war was still raging, I was enabled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
through the kindness of a distinguished naval
officer to pay an interesting visit to the capital
of the distracted kingdom of Korea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OUTLINE OF JOURNEY</div>

<p>The journey described in the following pages
was of a more ambitious character than those just
mentioned, and occupied the greater part of a year.
My intention was to ascend the Yangtse to the
province of Ssuch'uan, and thence to make my
way across that province to those principalities
of eastern Tibet that now own allegiance to the
emperor of China. I intended if possible to make
my way southward through those states, and so
enter the province of Yunnan; whence, as I knew
from the narratives of former travellers, I should
have no difficulty in making my way into Upper
Burma. The details of my route I left to be
determined by circumstances. Though I was
occasionally subjected to minor disappointments
and delays, the assistance of the various local
officials and the friendly spirit shown by the people
among whom I travelled enabled me to carry out
my plans with success.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

<p class="center">PEKING TO ICHANG</p>


<p>The first part of my journey was accomplished
with great rapidity, and my description of it will
not occupy long in the telling. I had no desire to
spend a longer time than was absolutely necessary
in northern China, and was glad enough to avail
myself of every facility for reaching Ichang&mdash;the
port on the Yangtse where steam navigation ceases&mdash;as
soon as possible. The recent completion of
the northern section of the great trunk railway
of China has rendered it possible to travel from
Peking to Hankow in four days,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> and so makes
it unnecessary to undertake a long and somewhat
dreary journey on horseback or in springless carts
over hundreds of miles of dusty plains and
impossible roads.</p>

<p>I left Wei-hai-wei on 6th January 1906 in
the steamer <i lang="zh">Shuntien</i>, and reached the ugly and
depressing little port of Chin-wang-tao on the 8th.
In the evening of the following day, after a night
spent in Tientsin, I reached the capital, and was
glad to exchange the discomfort of a monotonous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
railway journey for the luxury of that excellent
Peking hostelry the "Hôtel des Wagons Lits."
The next four days were spent in paying visits at
the British Legation and elsewhere, and in fighting
ineffectual battles against an unusually aggressive
dust-storm. No one, except perhaps a traveller
in the desert of Gobi or over the sand-dunes of
Khotan, can form any conception of the penetrating
power of Peking dust. Parched throats, husky
voices, bloodshot eyes, are the price that must be
paid for the pleasure of a walk through the streets
of Peking during a dust-storm; even one's own
residence is no sanctuary, for double window-sashes
and padded doors are alike powerless to
withstand the scourge. Most of the legations are
fairly well protected by their lofty park-walls, but
how to keep an ordinary Peking house or hotel
free of dust is as insoluble a problem as that which
baffled Alice's Walrus and Carpenter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PEKING</div><p>Peking being now one of the ordinary objectives
of the modern globe-trotter, I will not encroach
upon the province of the compiler of tourist guidebooks
by attempting a description. Even the
Englishman who has never left his native soil
knows something of the city that defied all the
Powers of Europe seven years ago, and paid so
bitterly for her defiance. There have, of course,
been great changes in Peking since those dark
days; but away from the railway stations and the
legation quarter, with its bristling guns, its battlemented
walls and its heterogeneous army of foreign
guards, there is little to show that Peking was so
recently in the grip of a victorious and remorseless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
enemy. Its streets, temples, shops and palaces are
very much as they were in 1900, showing the same
mixture of grandeur and sordidness, splendour and
decay. As for its people, who will venture to say
how much or how little they have changed? That
they love the people of Europe no better than they
did eight years ago may be taken for granted: I
am not aware that we have done anything to win
their affections. That they have learned something
of the secret of European prowess, and have
realised why our arms were resistless, even against
their Boxer champions, is no doubt true; and if
this lesson does not, for some strange reason, fill
them with admiration and reverence for Europe,
it is certainly teaching them where to seek a cure
for the ills of their own country. Events are now
making it clearer every day that a true spirit of
national feeling is rising among the people, and
that the best minds in China are devoting themselves
to the problem of their country's salvation.
Nowhere is this state of things more obvious than
in Peking, but it is not only in the capital that the
new spirit is working strange wonders among the
Chinese people. China is, indeed, rapidly growing
to be more than a mere geographical term. The
racial solidarity that is the underlying cause of
her wonderful power of passive resistance shows
no signs of disintegration at the present time,
and it will form the best possible foundation for
a new national patriotism. Only ten years ago
an English traveller and politician, predicting the
partition of China, explained that he used the
word "China" only for convenience, for "there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
is really no such thing as 'China' at all."<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> For
such a view there was some excuse at a time
when humbled China was lying wounded and
helpless at the feet of victorious Japan, but few,
I fancy, will be inclined to endorse it now.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHINESE POLITICS</div>

<p>The position of Peking at the present time is
one of peculiar interest, for all the different forces
that are now at work to make or mar China issue
from, or converge towards, the capital. There,
on the Dragon Throne, beside, or rather above, the
powerless and unhappy emperor, the father of his
people and their god, sits the astute and ever-watchful
lady whose word is law to emperor,
minister, and clown alike. There dwell the heads
of the Government boards, the leaders of the
Manchu aristocracy and the great political parties,
the drafters of new constitutions and imperial
decrees, and the keen-witted diplomatists who
know so well how to play against European
antagonists the great game of international chess.
To Peking come the memorials of viceroys and
provincial governors; indictments and denunciations
against high officials for ultra-Conservatism
or for Radicalism; bulky petitions from visionary
students who have studied Western politics, and
hope against hope that their proposed measures
of reform may chance to come under the imperial
eye. And there the great Powers of the West,
reproducing in miniature the mighty armed camps
of Europe, watch each other with jealous eyes
from the gates of their embattled legations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

<p>The Lu-Han railway, by which I left the
Capital on 13th January, brought me to Hankow
on the evening of the 16th. The total distance
is 1,223 kilometres, or about 759 miles. The
provinces traversed by this great trunk line are
Chihli, Honan, and Hupei. The line for the most
part lies through a rich, flat country, studded with
innumerable trees, villages, and farmsteads, but presenting
no features of special interest to the ordinary
traveller. The train stopped every evening, and
resumed the journey early each morning, the first
stage being completed at Shun-tê-fu, in Chihli.
The second day we entered the province of Honan
and crossed the Yellow River by the great bridge
which has been the subject of so much criticism
and discussion in engineering circles in the East.
The construction of this bridge&mdash;a screw-pile
structure almost two miles long&mdash;was by far
the most serious and costly work that faced the
French and Belgian engineers in the course of their
labours, the chief difficulties consisting in the
enormous rise and fall in the river and the shifting
sands and almost fathomless mud of its bed.
What must strike most travellers who are devoid
of any technical knowledge of engineering are the
great length of the bridge, the flimsiness of its
appearance (for its massive supports are sunk far
below the bed of the river), and its narrowness.
Whether it is really fit to stand the strain of an
abnormal summer flood, and whether its piers have
been sunk sufficiently deep to ensure permanent
stability, are questions which time and experience
alone can solve. It had only been opened a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
weeks before I crossed it, and since then traffic
has had to be suspended more than once. Only
one train could pass over the bridge at a time,
and each was taken across by a special light
engine.</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="SOUTH_BANK_OF_YELLOW_RIVER"></a>

<div class="caption">SOUTH BANK OF YELLOW RIVER, WITH VIEW OF RAILWAY BRIDGE.</div>
</div>


<div class="sidenote">RAILWAY-TRAVELLING IN CHINA</div>

<p>The second day's journey was completed at
Chêng-chou, half an hour's journey from the
south bank of the Yellow River. Here I found
a quasi-European inn named the "Hotel Pericles,"
kept by an Italian ex-railway employee. Macaroni
and chianti and the genial conversation of our
host, Mr P. Mouchtouris, and two of his compatriots,
afforded a cheerful interlude in a somewhat
monotonous journey.</p>

<p>At the close of the third day we found ourselves
at a place called Chu Ma-tien&mdash;a railway
depôt only, not within sight of any large centre
of population. On the following day we passed
through the mountainous country that divides the
provinces of Honan and Hupei, with scenery the
most picturesque to be found anywhere between
the two railway termini. Hankow itself, which
was reached a few hours later, lies on the flat
banks of the Yangtse, at a distance of about
600 miles from Shanghai. On the opposite bank
of the great river lies the provincial capital,
Wu-ch'ang, the seat of Government of the viceroy
or governor-general; while on the same side of
the river as Hankow, but separated from it by
the Han river, lies Han-Yang. These three
places together form what is practically one vast
city of something like two million inhabitants:
a city so favourably situated in the heart of China<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
that it can hardly fail to become a commercial
capital of pre-eminent importance. The large
European trading community is fully alive to this
fact, and building land is rapidly increasing in
value. It is the terminus of the ocean-going
vessels, and the starting-point of the smaller cargo
and passenger-steamers bound for Ichang, about
390 miles further up the river. Hankow also
derives great advantage from its position&mdash;denoted
by its name&mdash;at the mouth of the Han, one of
the Yangtse's greatest tributaries, itself navigable
for native cargo boats for no less than 1,200
miles. Finally, Hankow is at present the terminus
of China's only trunk railway, that by which I
travelled from Peking, and it will soon be similarly
connected with Canton in the south. It is perhaps
no exaggeration to say that there is hardly a city
in the whole world that has a greater commercial
and industrial future before it than Hankow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RAILWAYS IN CHINA</div>

<p>That the railway will pay, and pay enormously&mdash;especially
when the connections with Canton
and Kowloon are completed&mdash;is a matter beyond
all possibility of doubt. That it will be of real
benefit to the people of China is more to the
point. It will undoubtedly enable the native
merchants and farmers to send their goods and
produce to markets which were formerly unattainable
by them, and will go far towards minimising
the misery caused by local famines. There is
plenty of evidence that the Chinese are everywhere
anxious and delighted to avail themselves
of the wonderful new force that has been introduced
into their country: the old days when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
Shanghai-Wusung railway had to be sold by the
foreign owners to the Chinese Government, and
was then deliberately wrecked and abolished to
appease the prejudices of anti-foreign mobs,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> have
passed for ever away. The final proof&mdash;if one
were needed&mdash;that the Chinese Government has
definitely surrendered its old anti-railway policy,
lies in the fact that it is itself promoting the
construction of purely Chinese lines such as that
from Peking to Kalgan; lines not only owned
by Chinese capitalists, but actually engineered and
constructed by Chinese engineers and contractors.
The recent opposition of the Government to the
construction of such lines as that from Kowloon
to Canton, or from the Burmese frontier to
T'êng-yüeh, lies simply in the rapidly-growing
national hostility to the monopolisation of Chinese
industrial enterprises by foreign capital, and the
interference of foreign Powers&mdash;based on their
subjects' pecuniary stake in the country&mdash;in the
internal affairs of the empire. Therefore, though
we hear a great deal just now about the difficulties
placed by Chinese officialdom in the way of
the employment of foreign engineers and foreign
capital in railway construction and the exploitation
of mines, this must not be interpreted as a
reluctance on the part of China to have railways
built or to have the mineral wealth of the country
opened up. It is merely that the Chinese wish
to build their own railways, and to work their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
own mines, in order that international disputes
and political dangers may be avoided and that
China may be exploited for the primary benefit
of the Chinese Government and people, rather
than for the benefit of foreign Governments and
foreign capitalists. The European points out that
the Chinese, either from want of money or from
lack of technical knowledge and experience, are
incapable of giving effect to these admirable ideals,
however much they might wish to do so; to
which the Chinese retort that rather than tolerate
foreign interference, they prefer to wait until
these disadvantages can be obviated, even if the
country's advance in wealth and civilisation is
thereby retarded. This attitude, even if economically
unsound, is quite a natural one in the
circumstances; but, unfortunately, there are a
number of people in Europe and in the Far East
who seem to regard any attempt made by China
to keep or regain control of her own resources
as a kind of international crime, which must, if
necessary, be punished by gun-boats and bayonets.
We resent the introduction of a Chinese element
into British Columbia, Australia, and South
Africa, but we make bitter protests against the
"anti-foreign feeling in China" if the responsible
statesmen of that country refuse to silence the
cry of "China for the Chinese."</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHANG CHIH-TUNG ON RAILWAYS</div>

<p>The Viceroy Chang Chih-tung&mdash;one of those
able statesmen who prevented the spread of
Boxerism in the Yangtse valley and so saved
foreign commercial interests there from a serious
disaster&mdash;was one of the first high officials in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
China to realise the benefit that would accrue to
all classes of the community from the construction
of railways. "Is there any one power," he wrote,
"that will open the door of learning for the
scholar, the farmer, the workman, the merchant,
and the soldier? To this question we reply
emphatically, there is, and it is the Railway.
The potentialities of the scholar lie in extensive
observation; of the farmer, in finding a ready sale
for farm products; of the workman, in the increase
of machinery; of the merchant, in cheap and
rapid transit; and of the soldier, in the quick
despatch of the munitions of war.... The Railway
is the source of the wealth and power of
Western countries.... How can the people of
our Flowery Inner Land progress, or even exist,
without railways?"<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> This emphatic declaration
by one of the greatest and most patriotic of
Chinese officials is significant in more ways than
one. China is to have railways, not merely as a
means of rapid transport for merchandise and
produce, but for the purpose of consolidating the
military strength of the empire.</p>

<p>It must be a matter of serious regret to
Chinese statesmen that the resources of the
country&mdash;both in capital and in engineering skill&mdash;were
not sufficient to enable China to undertake
the whole financing and construction of the great
trunk railway; and there can be little doubt that
as soon as China is in a position to act upon
Article V. of the Belgian Agreement, which she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
is entitled to do any time after 1907, she will
refund all the Franco-Belgian capital advanced
to her under the terms of that Agreement, and
take over entire control of the whole northern
section of the railway. It would probably be to
the entire advantage of legitimate foreign trade
and enterprise in China that she should do so, and
the eventual benefit to be derived by China herself
would be incalculable&mdash;provided, of course, that she
honourably fulfilled her commercial treaties with
the Western Powers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On arrival at Hankow I spent two days in
making such meagre preparations as I considered
necessary for my long journey into the interior;
for Hankow&mdash;being only four days distant by
steamer from Shanghai&mdash;is the last town where
it is possible to purchase European stores at a
reasonable price.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN UNLUCKY STEAMER</div>

<p>Shallow-draft steamers with excellent accommodation
for both Chinese and Europeans leave
Hankow for Ichang two or three times a week.
The traffic is divided among British, Chinese
and Japanese companies. It was by a Japanese
steamer that I started for the Upper Yangtse on
18th January. Our journey was not devoid of
unforeseen incident. All went well until the
21st, when we ran on a shoal. All our efforts
to get off proved unavailing till the 23rd, when
by means of the process known to naval men,
I understand as kedging, we hauled ourselves
into deep water. This, however, was not effected
without breaking a chain-cable and losing a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
valuable anchor, which sank irrecoverably in the
mud. Our Japanese captain then announced
that the vessel drew so much water that he
could not then attempt the only available channel,
and that there was no alternative but to return
to Hankow and discharge some of the cargo.
This caused intense dissatisfaction among the
hundreds of Chinese passengers, most of whom
were on their way to their homes to spend Chinese
New Year's Day (which fell on 25th January)
with their families. Some of the passengers,
I was informed, actually threatened to use force
to compel the captain to proceed, and were only
pacified when they were given the option of going
ashore in the ship's boats, and finding their own
way to their several destinations. Twenty or
thirty passengers availed themselves of this offer,
and were packed into a single boat towed by the
ship's steam-launch. On their way to the shore
some unfortunate accident caused the boat&mdash;which
was by no means over-crowded&mdash;to upset, and all
the passengers were thrown into the water. I
never learned the exact number of those who were
drowned, for no proper tally of the passengers
who had embarked appears to have been kept,
but it was almost certainly not more than three.
The rescued passengers were all bundled into
the steam-launch, the boat (which was bottom
upwards) temporarily abandoned, and the survivors
brought back to the ship. The families of the
poor fellows who paid so severe a penalty for
their anxiety to reach their homes were doubtless
waiting to welcome them with all the exuberant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
joy that the New Year festival brings into even
the poorest Chinese household; and it was sad
to reflect that in all probability no word of the
tragedy would reach them until those whom they
were waiting to greet were laid down at the doors
of their homes in their coffins.</p>

<p>This sad event did not complete the chapter
of our accidents. After we had anchored for the
night some miles lower down the river, on our
return journey to Hankow, our vessel was swung
round by a back-eddy and crashed into several
junks moored close to the shore. The damage,
fortunately, was not very serious, and was
promptly paid for by the captain of our ship. On
the following day the ship's compradore came to
me and asked if I could give him any medicine
for a Chinese passenger who was showing signs
of lunacy or delirium. As I had no remedies of
the kind required, I could only recommend him
to keep his patient under careful control until
we reached Hankow. But about the middle of
the day the poor man eluded the vigilance of
those who, I presume, were looking after him,
and deliberately jumped overboard. The ship was
immediately stopped, a boat lowered with great
promptitude, and the man rescued: he had never
sunk below the surface, and it was obvious that
he owed his safety entirely to his thickly-wadded
winter garments, which were tied tightly at the
waist and ankles and served as a temporary life-buoy.
The cold waters of the wintry Yangtse had
a more beneficial effect upon him than any drug,
for on our arrival at Hankow he appeared to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
completely restored to health. Just before we
dropped anchor off the Hankow bund, one of
the Chinese crew fell down the companion and
damaged his ankle. Whether any further disasters
occurred on board this unlucky vessel is unknown
to me, as the same evening I hastily transferred
my luggage, my dog and myself to the ship <i lang="zh">T'ai
Yuan</i>, which was due to leave for Ichang early
the following morning. I was not surprised
to hear that the loss to the owners owing to
this unfortunate journey was estimated at not
less than $10,000. Fortunately for the shareholders,
the company is subsidised by the Japanese
Government.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ACCIDENTS ON THE YANGTSE</div>

<p>The <i lang="zh">T'ai Yuan</i>, which was the property of the
same company, was evidently smiled upon by a
less malevolent star, for nothing except an hour's
fog on the second morning interfered with our
passage to Ichang. On arriving at the little treaty
port of Sha-shih, on the morning of 30th January,
I found from conversation with one of the Customs
officials stationed there that the news of the
tragedy described above had reached that port in
a very distorted form. He asked me if it were
true that twenty passengers had been drowned!
In the evening of the same day we cast anchor
at Ichang, where the number of the men reported
to have lost their lives had risen to thirty.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

<p class="center">ICHANG TO WAN-HSIEN, THROUGH THE
YANGTSE GORGES</p>


<p>Just before Ichang is reached, the appearance of
the Yangtse valley undergoes a sudden change.
The great flat plains of the Lower Yangtse are
left behind, and rugged hills creep gradually up
to the river's edge. Ichang owes its importance
to the fact that it is situated at the eastern
entrance of the great gorges of the Upper
Yangtse, at the highest point of the river which
is at present attainable by steamers. Its distance
from the mouth of the Yangtse is almost exactly
1,000 miles. Its situation on the left bank of
the river, facing a striking mountain the shape
and size of which are said to be almost identical
with those of the Great Pyramid of Egypt, is very
picturesque. The town is not large, the population
being barely 40,000, including about thirty
or forty Europeans, the majority of whom are
missionaries. There are also consular and customs
officials, and a few merchants. The port has been
opened to foreign trade for many years, but there
has not as yet been any great commercial boom.
It is, indeed, little but a port of trans-shipment.
The main item in the out-going trade is native<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
opium, for the poppy is grown very extensively
in the valleys above Ichang. The town will therefore
be considerably affected by the new anti-opium
regulations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NAVIGATION ON UPPER YANGTSE</div>

<p>Cargoes arriving by steamer and destined for
the markets of the rich province that lies beyond
the gorges are at Ichang transferred to large river
junks. These junks, if they are fortunate enough
to escape the manifold dangers of rocks and rapids,
are hauled through the gorges by small armies of
trackers, and take a month at least&mdash;sometimes
far more&mdash;to cover the 400 miles between Ichang
and Chung-king. With a favourable wind they
can travel under their own sail in the smooth
water between the rapids, but even then, owing
to the strong current, the rate of progress is slow.</p>

<p>The right of steam navigation on the Upper
Yangtse from Ichang to Chung-king and Hsü-chou-fu
(Sui-fu) has existed since 1894, but the
problem of the rapids is still an unsolved one,
and steamboats can only attempt the journey
at a great risk. The dangerous portion is the
200 miles between Ichang and Wan-hsien. Mr
Archibald Little successfully navigated his <i lang="zh">Lee-chuen</i>
through the gorges in 1898, but few
attempts have since been made to connect Ichang
and Chung-king by steam, though it is obvious
that owing to the great cost and risk of the
present methods of carrying on trade with the
markets of Ssuch'uan, the development of a
flourishing trade with that exceedingly rich and
prosperous province is a matter of great difficulty.
France, no doubt, hopes that by the extension of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
her Yunnan railway beyond Yunnan-fu the trade
of Ssuch'uan will to some extent be diverted to
Tongking and Haiphong, but she is, of course,
fully cognisant of the fact that once the problem
of the Yangtse rapids is solved by engineering
skill, any such trade as she may have captured
will inevitably find its way back to its natural
channel. It is to be hoped, therefore, in the
interests of China and Great Britain, that the
problem will before long be tackled in real earnest
by competent persons; it is certainly not one on
which the opinion of amateurs is of any value.
British river gun-boats have surmounted the
obstacles on several occasions,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> and a couple of
such vessels are now kept in permanent commission
in the tranquil waters between Wan-hsien
and Hsü-chou-fu. In summer they also ascend
the Min river (which enters the Yangtse at Hsü-chou-fu)
as far as Chia-ting, a distance from
Shanghai of about 1,680 miles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHINESE RED-BOATS</div>

<p>Apart from the serious question of the rapids,
there is no doubt that the Yangtse, with its tributaries,
forms a magnificent system of navigable
rivers. Not only can gun-boats ascend the Min
river as far as Chia-ting, but native craft further
ascend at all times of the year as far as Ch'êng-tu,
the capital of Ssuch'uan, a distance of 133
miles above Chia-ting, and over 1,800 miles from
Shanghai. The main stream of the river known
to Europeans as the Yangtse is navigable only to
P'ing-shan, 40 miles above Hsü-chou-fu, making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
a total distance from the Pacific Ocean of about
1,600 miles. It is on account of the shorter
navigable distance of the main stream that the
Chinese popularly regard the so-called Min as the
true Great River. Chia-ting is within a day's
journey of Mount Omei, and from the summit
of Mount Omei one can see the Great Snow
Mountains which form the eastern buttress of the
Tibetan plateau. It is thus possible to penetrate
by steam-boat or other vessel so far into the
interior of China as to be within sight of her
western boundary. This fact may surely be
adduced in support of the contention that China
possesses the finest system of navigable waterways
in the world.</p>

<p>At Ichang, through the kind assistance of
Mr H. H. Fox, British Consul at that port, and
by the courtesy of the local Chinese officials, I
procured a "red-boat" to convey myself and
my faithful bull-terrier Jim up the rapids and
through the gorges to Wan-hsien. The so-called
red-boats are Chinese Government life-boats.
There are several stationed in the neighbourhood
of each of the most dangerous rapids, and they are
manned by skilful and daring water-men. Every
year a large percentage of the trading junks are
wrecked in the rapids, and the annual loss of life,
great as it is, would be appalling if it were not
for the red-boats. This life-saving institution is
maintained by Government with the assistance of
voluntary contributions. A subscription towards
the up-keep of the service is granted annually by
the British Admiralty. There is no institution in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
China which reflects more credit on the government
of the country, and is more deserving of
unqualified praise.</p>

<p>In a red-boat I was more cramped in space
than I should have been in one of the large house-boats
usually chartered by European travellers,
but my rate of progress was much more speedy.
My only shelter was a mat-awning, open at both
ends, and as the thermometer rarely went above
45°, and at night often went down to 36°, I should
have suffered some inconvenience from the cold had
I not been able to exercise myself by scrambling
along the rocks and boulders ahead of my trackers.
The red-boat in which I travelled was, of course,
specially detached for my use and exempted from
the performance of its ordinary duties, though
for part of the way it acted as escort to a naval
officer who was going up the river in one of the
ordinary house-boats to join his ship.</p>

<div class="sidenote">YANGTSE GORGES</div>

<p>So many descriptions&mdash;good, bad, and indifferent&mdash;of
the wonders of the Yangtse gorges
have already been thrust into the hands of a more
or less grateful public, that most of my readers
may be glad to learn that I do not intend to add
to the number. The travellers who in recent
years have endeavoured to emulate the excellent
accounts of such pioneers as Mr Archibald Little
are so numerous that I would in all diffidence
suggest to those who may hereafter desire to
publish their "impressions" of the gorges, that it
would be a graceful act on their part to pay a
small fine&mdash;let it be a large one if the public
receives their work with cordiality&mdash;towards the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
funds of the life-boat service. It would certainly
be impossible to find a worthier object for their
generosity. All I will venture to say myself&mdash;though
I have already paid my fine&mdash;is that no
description of the scenery of the gorges can do
justice to the reality. For though I have beheld
scenery more beautiful and quite as grand, I
never saw anything in my travels that filled me
with a deeper sense of awe. Perhaps one of the
secrets of the fascination of the gorges is the ever-present
contrast between the dumb forces of nature
and evanescent humanity. For ages past human
muscle has matched itself in a brave struggle with
those titanic forces. The very rocks themselves,
the standing symbol of changelessness, reveal something
of the history of this unending strife. The
smooth grooves worn deep into the jagged summits
of innumerable crags have been scooped out
by the ropes hauled by a hundred generations of
dead trackers, and just above the water-line the
deep holes in the hard lime-stone made by the
poles of millions of toiling junkmen in past
centuries are still used as hooks and points of
leverage by their descendants of to-day. When
it is remembered that more than a hundred
trackers are sometimes required to haul a single
junk against the current of the greater rapids,
and that a junk may take half a day in covering
a distance of 200 yards, some idea will be formed
of the permanent difficulties that confront, and
always have confronted, the indomitable Chinese
navigator on these inland waters.</p>

<p>Much has been written by former travellers on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
the subject of the terribly hard lives led by the
Yangtse trackers, but I am not sure that the
degradation of the tracker and the wretchedness of
his life have not been greatly over-stated. Hard as
the work is, the trackers' mode of life can be by no
means unhealthy, and their daily food is, from the
Chinese point of view, both plentiful and good.
Better than all, their work is in its way interesting,
and of such a nature that it can never become
really monotonous. That they take a genuine
satisfaction in its accomplishment, quite apart
from the reward they are to receive, seemed to
me, as I watched them at their labours, an obvious
fact. I fancy that Ruskin would have supported
the view that the tracker's lot is by no means so
pitiable as that of myriads of factory hands in
the hideous industrial centres of modern Europe.
Personally, if I had to choose between hauling
junks over rapids in the magnificent gorges of
the Yangtse, and pulling cranks and levers in a
dismal Lancashire factory, I should not for a
moment hesitate in my choice: and I should not
choose the cranks and levers.</p>

<p>My journey from Ichang to Wan-hsien
occupied eleven days. We started on 2nd
February, reached Pu-tai K'ou (the boundary
between the provinces of Hupei and Ssuch'uan)
on the 6th, passed through the Fêng Hsiang
gorge&mdash;perhaps the grandest of all the defiles&mdash;on
the 8th, and beached ourselves under the walls
of the city of Wan-hsien on the morning of the
12th. Here I paid off my hardy boatmen, and
prepared for my overland journey to Ch'êng-tu.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

<p class="center">WAN-HSIEN TO CH'ÊNG-TU</p>


<p>Wan-hsien, though one of the most beautifully
situated cities on the Yangtse, is, like most
Chinese towns, more pleasing at a distance than
close at hand. It lies on a slope at a bend of
the river 200 miles above Ichang, and 1,200 miles
from the ocean. It is not yet an open port,
though I was shown a spot said to have been
selected by the British consular authorities as the
site of the future Consulate. The only resident
Europeans are a few missionaries and a postal
agent. The trade of the city is brisk and developing,
for the numerous roads that lead from here
into the interior of the province are much used
by the native merchants of Ssuch'uan for the
conveyance of their goods to the river. In time
to come Wan-hsien will no doubt reap a large
profit from its advantageous position at the point
of contact of several main arteries of traffic.</p>

<p>At Wan-hsien I was very hospitably entertained
for a day and a night by the Rev. J. C.
Platt, of the China Inland Mission, who was also
most courteous in assisting me in the engagement
of coolies for the next stage of my journey.</p>

<p>My caravan consisted of three coolies to carry
my sedan chair (purchased at Wan-hsien), which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
I very seldom used, three to carry my baggage,
and a temporary "boy," or personal servant, who
was engaged to accompany me as far as Ch'êng-tu,
the capital of the province. I was also furnished
by the <i lang="zh">chih hsien</i>, or district magistrate, with the
usual escort of two or three Chinese soldiers who,
whether they are wanted or not, always accompany
Europeans on overland journeys in China.
From this point onwards my method was to
engage temporary coolies and "boys" at various
stages of my journey, discharging them as soon as
I had passed out of the district in which their
local knowledge rendered them specially useful. I
lived entirely on native food, except on the rare
occasions on which I enjoyed the hospitality of
European missionaries. My knowledge of Chinese
rendered me independent of interpreters or guides,
though the changes of dialect were sometimes
disconcerting.</p>

<div class="caption">A CHINESE "BRAVE."</div>
</div>


<div class="sidenote">SCENERY OF EASTERN SSUCH'UAN</div>

<p>The journey from Wan-hsien to Ch'êng-tu consisted
of fourteen long stages, the total distance
being nearly 400 miles.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> The road lies through
one of the fairest and most fertile portions of
the great province of Ssuch'uan, and is one
of the best I have met with in the interior
of China: a circumstance which is partly due to
the fact that Chinese officials generally use this
road in travelling from the east of China to the
provincial capital. The inns are numerous and&mdash;from
the Oriental point of view&mdash;fairly comfortable.
The innkeepers, so far from showing any
aversion to entertaining foreigners, tout eagerly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>for their custom, and generally greet one with
the amiable remark "_t'zŭ hou ta jên_" ("At your
Excellency's service") as one enters their courtyards.
The people are peaceful and industrious,
and annoy foreigners only by their insatiable curiosity.
Europeans have not very often travelled
by this road, as they generally prefer&mdash;having
a good deal of heavy baggage&mdash;to keep to the
Yangtse as far as Chung-king, and thence ascend
the Min river; but there are now several missionary
stations between Wan-hsien and Ch'êng-tu,
and the country is quite well known to foreigners.
The road lies partly over undulating hills, generally
cultivated almost to their summits with rice,
rape, wheat, maize, and many other crops, and
partly over rich and densely-populated plains.
The scenery is always picturesque, and sometimes,&mdash;among
the hills&mdash;exceedingly beautiful. The
villages, farm-houses, and temples are generally
situated amid little forests of feathery bamboo.
The hill-sides are studded with charming little
<i lang="fr">châlets</i>, and very often the submerged rice-fields
in their immediate vicinity give the appearance
of artificial lakes in an English park, especially
when the banks or balks are lined with graceful
vegetation. My dog, I was glad to find, attracted
much greater attention than I did myself: for
bull-terriers are unknown in China. Delighted
cries of "_K'an yang kou_" ("Look at the foreign
dog!") greeted us whenever we entered a village
street, and in some places delight was tempered
by amazement. "Call that a dog?" I heard a
village patriarch remark rebukingly. "It's a bear!"<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
My readers may rest assured that my four-footed
travelling companion was no more like a bear
than a unicorn.</p>

<p>Though the climate of Ssuch'uan is always
comparatively mild, the mornings were generally
chilly enough to make walking a pleasanter mode
of progression than chair-riding. The method
adopted by the peasantry to keep themselves
warm struck me as distinctly novel. They carry
in their hands little wicker-baskets, in which is a
diminutive metal receptacle containing glowing
charcoal. This is the Ssuch'uanese equivalent to
a European lady's muff; but sometimes they hide
it away under their clothes, in which case their
appearance is apt to be rather comic.</p>

<p>My second night after leaving Wan-hsien was
spent in the small district city of Liang-shan,
where the late Mrs Bishop, as she relates in
her <i>Yangtse Valley and Beyond</i>, was mobbed
and assaulted. No such unpleasant experience
awaited me, and I found the people orderly and
good-humoured. The evening of the fourth day
brought me to Ta Chu, where I found an unusually
good inn. Those who have travelled much
in China need not be reminded of the joy with
which one finds comfortable quarters awaiting
one at the end of a tiring day's journey; the
experience is none too common. During the
fifth day's march I passed several out-crops of
coal. It seems to exist in great abundance,
though mining operations do not appear to have
been carried far below the surface. The coal is
used in the inns of this district, and burns well.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
On the sixth day we crossed the Ch'ü river in a
ferry-boat. This stream, which is navigable for
local craft, rises in the high range of hills in the
north-east of Ssuch'uan, and for part of its course
is known as the Pai Shui, or White Water. Ch'ü-hsien
and Kuang-an are the only fair-sized towns
on its banks, the point at which I crossed being
between these two towns. The river joins the
Chia-ling, with other tributaries, at Ho-chou,
and so goes to swell the Yangtse at Chung-king.
The water is remarkably clear. The summer rise,
judging from the appearance of the banks, is
probably not more than 10 feet, if so much.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SHUN-CH'ING-FU</div>

<p>On the eighth day from Wan-hsien I reached
the prefectural city of Shun-ch'ing-fu,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> once a
prosperous industrial centre but now somewhat
decayed. A great industry here used to be the
preparation of vegetable dyes from the safflower,
but the trade has been killed by the introduction
of aniline dyes from Austria. Sericulture, however,
is still a flourishing industry. Three or four
years ago a disaster befell the city in the shape of
floods, which destroyed whole streets and undermined
portions of the city wall.</p>

<p>Soon after leaving Shun-ch'ing our road lay
over an excellent four-arched bridge called the
Jung An Ch'iao ("Everlasting Peace Bridge"),
and we then began the ascent of a hill commonly
known locally as the Hsi Shan, or West Hill.
Here there are cavern-shrines, and a number of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
honorific portals and tablets, which indeed are
exceedingly common along all the main roads of
Ssuch'uan. Many of the inscriptions consist of
"legends of good women," but the great majority
commemorate the virtues of local officials. The
carved figures on the buildings of the Hsi Shan
are curious and interesting, and would probably
repay study. Some distance beyond this point I
observed a large flat rock close to the road, bearing
the significant inscription: <i lang="zh">Ch'i ssŭ wu kao
chuang</i> ("Die of anger but don't go to law").
This is part of a well-known proverb which goes
on to say: <i lang="zh">O ssŭ wu tso tsei</i> ("Die of hunger
but don't be a thief"). It would be well for the
peasantry of China&mdash;who as often as not ruin
themselves over their law-suits&mdash;if they would
pay as much respect to the first of these injunctions
as they generally do to the second.</p>

<p>On the 25th February my road descended from
an undulating range of hills to the edge of the
great plain, in the middle of which is situated
the provincial capital, Ch'êng-tu; but it was not
till the close of the following day, the fourteenth
since leaving Wan-hsien, that we entered the city.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIGHWAYMEN</div>

<p>As in all wealthy centres, the contrast between
the rich and poor in the Ch'êng-tu plain is very
striking. I never met so much evidence of great
wealth elsewhere in China, and certainly never
encountered so many beggars. One of them,
seeing that I was alone and on foot&mdash;for I had
left my chair some distance behind&mdash;offered to
carry me to Ch'êng-tu on his back. Another
tried to impress upon me the advantages of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
wheelbarrow as a mode of conveyance, though
its wooden wheel was nearly broken in half. The
number of bad characters in the city and
neighbourhood seemed to me unusually large,
and I was constantly warned against highway
robbers. I hardly expected to have the good
fortune to meet so picturesque a villain as a real
highwayman, but such was my fate during my
last day's journey before entering Ch'êng-tu.
There were two of them, armed with pistols that
were not only loaded, but could be discharged&mdash;a
feature that is not characteristic of all Chinese firearms.
They were lurking behind some bamboos
on the side of the road, apparently waiting for
an opportunity to attack and plunder any one
whose docility of appearance marked him out as
a suitable victim. One of them took fright at
the sudden apparition of the three soldiers of my
escort, who were walking in front of my chair,
and bolted. He was immediately followed by
his companion, and close on their heels came my
scarlet-coated warriors, emboldened, no doubt, by
the knowledge of the fact that they were three
to two. I caused my chair to be put down in
order that I might the better observe the race,
and the fight which I supposed would ensue.
But there was no struggle. Both the highwaymen,
encumbered by the weight of their unwieldy
pistols and a couple of heavy knives, were speedily
overtaken and captured, and, when brought back
to me, threw themselves to the ground and
made a piteous appeal to my generosity. They
explained that they had found the knives and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
pistols in a field, and were trying to find the
original owner in order to return them to him,
and that they had no idea (until we demonstrated
the fact by firing off the weapons) that the pistols
were loaded. Whether they took up the same
line of defence in the presence of the magistrate
to whose care I consigned them, I do not know,
nor have I learned their subsequent fate.</p>

<p>The Ch'êng-tu plain, with its marvellous system
of irrigation and its three or four crops a year, is
the richest and most populous district in the whole
of the Chinese Empire. This extraordinarily productive
plain is about 90 miles long by 70 wide,
and supports a population estimated at no less
than 4,000,000, of whom about 350,000 reside
within the capital itself. It is studded with many
prosperous towns and villages, and is cultivated
to its utmost extent. Among the crops are rice,
wheat, tea, tobacco, maize, the opium-poppy,
which was not yet in bloom, and the yellow rape
that turned hundreds of acres of land into seas
of bright gold. The plain is connected by a
navigable waterway (the Min) with the Yangtse,
and it is in the heart of the richest province in
China. The city of Ch'êng-tu has been identified
with Marco Polo's Sindafu. "This city," wrote
Marco in the thirteenth century, "was in former
times a rich and noble one, and the kings who
reigned there were very great and wealthy." Of
the Min river&mdash;which had not then been subdivided
to the same extent as at present into
artificial channels for irrigation&mdash;he says: "The
multitude of vessels that navigate this river is so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
vast that no one who should read or hear the
tale would believe it. The quantities of merchandise
also which merchants carry up and down this
river are past all belief."<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CH'ÊNG-TU</div>

<p>Ch'êng-tu is a city of less importance now, but
it is still one of the greatest and most prosperous
in China. Its population is much smaller than
that of Canton, but its general appearance is more
attractive as well as far more imposing. Its streets
are broad and clean, and its wall exceedingly well
preserved. In mediæval times it was a frontier
city of great political and strategic importance,
for the Tibetan principalities extended then as
far east as the lofty mountains that flank the
Ch'êng-tu plain on the west. Even now large
numbers of Tibetan traders are often to be seen
in the streets of Ch'êng-tu, though most of their
commercial transactions are carried on at the
city of Kuan-hsien, about 30 miles away, a
place which is also remarkable for the sluices
which regulate the waters of the Min and divert
them, as occasion demands, into the irrigation
canals. The governor-general of Ssuch'uan, whose
yamen is in Ch'êng-tu, is more like a real viceroy
than any other provincial ruler in China, for he
it is who, on behalf of the emperor, holds sway
over, and receives the embassies of, the various
Tibetan princes and tribal chiefs of the extreme
west. There is at present a project to connect
Ch'êng-tu by rail with a point on the Yangtse,
probably in the neighbourhood of K'uei-chou-fu,
a town which I passed on my way from Ichang<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
to Wan-hsien. The provincial government&mdash;for
the railway project is entirely a Chinese one&mdash;is
at present actively engaged in trying to raise the
funds necessary for so large an undertaking, one
method being&mdash;so I was told&mdash;to compel every
local official to take a definite number of shares,
the number to vary according to the official's
rank and reputed wealth, each shareholder being
permitted to get rid of his shares in the best
way possible by distributing them among the
well-to-do people subject to his jurisdiction. In
passing through the towns and villages of eastern
Ssuch'uan, I noticed many Chinese proclamations
giving the people an outline of the railway scheme,
pointing out the great benefits to the trade and
prosperity of the province that would result from
its fulfilment, and inviting or commanding popular
co-operation. It may be that this railway will
offer one solution of the problem of the Yangtse
rapids: in any case, the enthusiasm with which
the scheme was being discussed in both official
and commercial circles was another proof of
the gradual breaking-down of the old Chinese
prejudice against railways.</p>

<p>Though so remote from the sea-board, the
people of Ch'êng-tu&mdash;or perhaps I should say
the officials&mdash;are among the most progressive
and enlightened in China. This is especially so
in the matter of education. The city possesses
a Provincial College, where about three hundred
young men are now being educated in Western
as well as in Chinese branches of learning. There
is an Englishman who lectures on chemistry and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
physics, there are several Japanese lecturers, and
a staff of Chinese teachers who have a knowledge
of European languages. I have heard of an enterprising
Chinese schoolmaster who once advertised
that in his establishment English was taught "up
to letter G." They are more ambitious than that
in the college of Ch'êng-tu. Among the local
industries the most important is that of silk-weaving.
For this, as well as for other industrial
purposes, foreign machinery and Western methods
are being gradually imported and adopted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BABER'S MONOLITH</div>

<p>Those who are acquainted with Baber's
charming descriptions of Ssuch'uan and Yunnan<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>&mdash;descriptions
which can never be superseded,
though they are often neglected nowadays&mdash;will
remember that he was much interested in a
curious circular monolith which he discovered on
the side of an artificial hill or mound in Ch'êng-tu.
He was unable to get any satisfactory account
of its history, though tradition said that it marked
the grave of an emperor's son. It is, indeed, not
improbable that the mound, which is oblong in
shape, with a depression in the middle, and
resembles, as Baber remarked, a half-buried dumbbell,
was raised in memory of some distinguished
prince or leader of old times, perhaps when the
Ch'êng-tu plain was still occupied by the so-called
Man-tzŭ. I visited the spot, and found that the
stone was still lying in the position in which he
saw it. The portion that appears above the soil
presents something of the appearance of the tilted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
end of a huge stone barrel, badly damaged at
one corner. The diameter of the circular face&mdash;of
which barely half can be seen&mdash;I found to be
about 17 feet. The greatest length of the visible
body of the barrel is only about 2 feet 3 inches,
but it is impossible to say how much of it is
underground. An excavation of the mound at
the spot where the stone lies might lead to some
interesting results: but Baber was assured that
any attempt to dig would cause the sky to darken
and goblins to appear, so he left it alone, and I
decided to follow his example.</p>

<p>Something of the grandeur of Ch'êng-tu in its
most palmy days may be realised by a reference to
extant Chinese books, as well as from the eulogies
of Marco Polo. From the <i lang="zh">Shu Hua Shih</i><a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> we
learn that under the T'ang dynasty (618-905 of
the Christian era) it was a great art centre, and a
long list of paintings and frescoes relating to the
Buddhist religion are mentioned in that work as
hanging on the walls of the palaces of Ch'êng-tu.
Some of the temples are worthy of a long visit,
though the finest in the district is not in the city
itself but in the neighbouring town of Kuan-hsien,
where Li Ping and his son, the deified founders
of the great irrigation system of the Ch'êng-tu
plain, have had raised in their honour a temple
that is said to be the most beautiful in China.
But as has been well remarked of Li Ping by a
recent English traveller,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> the perennially fertile
fields around Ch'êng-tu are his finest monument.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

<p class="center">CH'ÊNG-TU TO OMEI-HSIEN</p>


<p>My next objective after leaving Ch'êng-tu was
the sacred summit of Mount Omei, one of the
most famous of the many historic mountains
of China. I left Ch'êng-tu on 1st March in a
small, leaky, and most uncomfortable craft, which
took me down the Min river to Chia-ting in four
days, the total distance being slightly over 130
miles. The Kuan-hsien sluices having not yet
been opened to give the great plain its spring
flooding, there was very little water in the stream
till we reached Chiang K'ou<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> on the morning of
the third day, and in some places it was necessary
to pull the boat over some mud shoals. At Chiang
K'ou the various subdivided waters (of which the
branch that brought me down from the east gate
of Ch'êng-tu was one) reunite and form a river
which is broad and deep enough at all seasons
of the year for cargo-junks of a considerable size.
This is the Min river, which, as already stated, is
regarded by the Chinese of central Ssuch'uan as
the true Upper Yangtse. The far greater but unnavigable
stream which rushes impetuously from
the Tibetan mountains in the north-west and is
joined by the Min at Hsü-chou-fu,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> is known
by the Chinese for a great part of its course as
Chin Ho (Gold River) and as the Chin Sha<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
Chiang<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> (the River of Golden Sand). The name
Min being apparently unknown to the Chinese,
Baber suggested that it had been invented by
the early Jesuit geographers.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> If so, it was no
doubt derived from the range of mountains
known to the Chinese as the Min Shan (<span lang="cmn-Hant">岷山</span>)
in the north-west of the province, for it is there
that the river rises. But all the rivers of China
have a multitude of names; in fact the Chinese
do not appear to be endowed with a proper sense
of the continuity of rivers, and the country people
who dwell on the banks of a stream from which
they derive their livelihood are seldom aware of
where it comes from or whither it goes. This
circumstance has been a source of embarrassment
to many European travellers, whose passion for
geographical exactness is incomprehensible to the
rustic mind in China.</p>

<p>The scenery of the Min is always picturesque.
The river flows for the most part through richly
cultivated districts, broken only here and there by
low hills. Nearly opposite the town of P'êng-shan-hsien,
on the third day from Ch'êng-tu I
visited a fine twelve-storied pagoda (the So Chiang
T'a or Lock-River Pagoda), which, unlike most
buildings of the kind, is in sufficiently good repair
to enable one to ascend it by a spiral staircase.
The pagoda is built of hard brick and the staircase
is of sandstone blocks. The scenery on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
river becomes finer as one approaches Chia-ting.
Well-wooded hills come close to the water's edge,
and broken cliffs covered with verdure reveal openings
into fairy vistas of greenery and mysterious
grottoes that would have delighted the soul of
a Keats.</p>


<div class="figcenter" ><a id="A_CHINESE_WALLED_CITY"></a>
<img src="images/i_044fp.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">A CHINESE WALLED CITY.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">CHIA-TING-FU</div>

<p>The town of Chia-ting, which I reached on
the evening of 4th March, is beautifully situated
on the right bank of the Min, just above its
junction with the T'ung (more generally known
as the Ta Tu) and Ya rivers. From this point
onwards the three streams flow in a broad,
navigable river for a distance of about 130 miles,
when they join the Yangtse at Hsü-chou-fu. My
river-journey, however, ended at Chia-ting.</p>

<p>Apart from its proximity to the sacred mountain
of Omei, Chia-ting is interesting for its temples,
its prehistoric cave-dwellings, its sericulture, and
for the white-wax industry. High on a rocky
hill on the left bank of the river is a remarkable
monastery known as "The Monastery of the Voice
of the Waters." It was founded in the T'ang
dynasty, nearly twelve hundred years ago, and
restored in 1667 by the munificence of a Provincial
Judge. It bears the alternative name of "The
Great Buddha Monastery," the reference being
to a huge image which has been carved out of
the face of a cliff that overhangs the waters of
the Min. The story goes that a holy monk
named Hai T'ung came to this locality in the
eighth century of our era and determined to
perform some act of religious devotion which
would save the surrounding country from the
ruin and desolation caused by the overflowing of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
the three neighbouring rivers. He therefore spent
nineteen years in hewing out of the rock an immense
image of Maitrêya Buddha. The carving,
which is in bold relief, must have been a work
of immense labour and considerable danger; but
its artistic merits are obscured by the partial
decomposition of the rock and the growth of
vegetation in the fissures. Parts of the body are
almost indistinguishable. The whole figure is
about 386 feet high. An exceedingly steep and
rather perilous scramble down a cutting in the
precipice enabled me to study the great figure
from various points of vantage, and also to inspect
some little rock-shrines containing innumerable
small Buddhas. It is doleful to reflect that in
spite of Hai T'ung's piety and extraordinary
industry the three rivers have not yet ceased to
cause periodical floods.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MAN-TZŬ CAVES</div>

<p>Amongst other objects of great interest in
the monastic grounds are some of the prehistoric
cave-dwellings which were first described by
Baber. One of these caves, in close proximity to
the monastery, has been diverted from its original
uses (whatever they may have been), and is now
a Buddhist chapel, with altar, bell, and images all
complete. These caves, of which there are many
in the neighbourhood of Chia-ting and a great
quantity in other parts of what is known as the
"Red Basin" of Ssuch'uan, constitute one of
the unsolved problems of Chinese archæology. I
visited several of them during the two days I
spent at Chia-ting, but am not in a position to
add much to the information already available, or
to offer any novel theory regarding their origin.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
The caves are entirely artificial, and have been
hewn out of the sandstone by people who were
evidently skilful in the handling of their tools.
There is little evidence of a strong artistic instinct,
but it is curious to note that the decoration, such
as it is, bears no resemblance to any Chinese work,
and seems rather of Hindu type. The square or
oblong doors are generally on the face of a cliff,
and the majority are at the present time quite
inaccessible without the use of ropes and ladders.
In some cases the cliffs are honey-combed with
caves, the insides of which have never been trodden
by human foot for untold ages. Other caves,
however, are quite easily accessible. The interiors
vary in details, but in general design they are
alike. The door leads into a long room, which
is in most cases connected with other rooms, and
there are holes and grooves in the walls which
show that there must at one time have been
wooden partitions. Within the rooms, which are
quite lofty and broad enough for human habitation,
there are cistern-like troughs, deep recesses,
bench-like seats, and projections that may have
been used as shelves: all of which are hewn
out of the rock and remain immovable. No
one can now say definitely whether the caves
were used as strongholds, as tombs, as houses
or as places of worship. Arguments may be
adduced in support of each and all of these
theories. The inaccessibility of the majority of
the cave-apertures lends support to the stronghold
theory. Perhaps they were reached by temporary
ladders which were drawn up on the approach
of an enemy. Possibly the enemies to be feared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
in those remote days were wild beasts as well as
human beings. The narrow rooms, with their immovable
stone coffers and shallow recesses, suggest
mausolea; yet the existence in some cases of fire-places
(without chimneys) and stone projections
that were evidently intended to be sat upon are
more suggestive of dwelling-places. As regards
the temple theory, all that can be said is that
some of the more accessible of the caves have
been turned into Buddhist shrines, as in the case
already mentioned; but there is no evidence
whatever that they were originally intended for
religious purposes. On the whole, it seems probable
that the caves were actually used as the ordinary
dwelling-places of a primitive people that lived
chiefly by hunting and fishing, had attained a
fair degree of civilisation and social organisation,
and found themselves in constant danger of attack
by hostile tribes, perhaps Tibetans, by whom&mdash;if
not by advancing Chinese&mdash;they were eventually
scattered or exterminated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CAVE-DWELLERS</div>

<p>All I propose to add by way of comment
is this. In the <cite>Journal</cite> of the Royal Asiatic
Society for July 1904 and January 1906, Mr E.
Crawshay-Williams described some mysterious
rock-dwellings which he discovered at Raineh, in
Persia. Now from his description of those caves
I gather that they must be exactly similar in
situation, size, and general appearance to those
which we are now considering. Unfortunately,
neither the Raineh caves nor those of Ssuch'uan
contain inscriptions. Whether the resemblance is
purely accidental or has some deeper significance
is a question which I leave to archæologists. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
might, if we had corroborating evidence, tend to
show that regions so far apart as Persia and the
Min valley of Ssuch'uan were once inhabited by
allied races, perhaps of Indian origin. As we
shall see later,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> there is, indeed, some reason to
believe that the Chinese cave-dwellers were connected
with the Vaggians or Licchavis, a race
that attained to great political strength in the
extreme north-east of India, and which&mdash;according
to one authority at least&mdash;is identical with
the Yüeh-chi.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> The latter, however, who after
their disastrous defeats by the Hiung-nu on the
confines of China in the second century <small>B.C.</small>
migrated to western Asia, never seem to have
penetrated so far west as Raineh in Persia. Their
empire was founded on the ruins of the Græco-Bactrian
dominion in Sogdiana and on the left
bank of the Oxus, and their ambitions led them
south rather than west. It may be that future
explorers will discover in other regions caves of
a similar pattern to those of Persia and China,
and in that case it may be possible to trace the
migrations of the cave-dwellers and so find a clue
to their identification. The caves noticed by the
abbé Huc on the fringe of the Mongolian desert,
and those that exist near the Yamdok lake on
the road to Lhasa<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> have not been described fully
enough to justify our drawing many deductions.
The rock-cut caves on the Murghab near the
Afghan frontier, and those of Bamian close to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
Indian Caucasus on the road between Kabul and
Turkestan,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> have many characteristics in common
with those of Ssuch'uan, but appear to have
served only religious uses. Professor Parker has
discovered in the records of the T'ang dynasty
(seventh to tenth century <small>A.D.</small>) what appear to
be references to the existence of a race of cave-dwellers
in Ssuch'uan as late as that time, and
a further reference to cave-chiefs (one of whom
was named T'ien Shih Ch'iung) in records corresponding
to the year 1012 of our era.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> But there
is nothing to prove that these were the descendants
of the original cave-dwelling race, and the
probabilities are rather against their being so.</p>

<p>What the Chinese themselves say is that
the caves were inhabited by the "Man-tzŭ" in
prehistoric times; but Man-tzŭ is a term which
has a very elastic meaning, for, as we shall see
below,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> it has been made to embrace Tibetan
border tribes, Lolos and "savages" generally.
It must reluctantly be admitted that until a
proper archæological enquiry has been made into
the subject and the more inaccessible caves have
been thoroughly searched for relics, the only
theory with which no fault can be found is the
illuminating one propounded by Baber. "My
own theory," he said, "which I offer with diffidence,
is that these excavations are of unknown
date, and have been undertaken, for unexplained
purposes, by a people of doubtful identity."</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHINESE INNS</div>

<p>On 6th March I set out for Omei-hsien, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
little city that lies at the foot of Mount Omei.
The distance from Chia-ting is only about 16
miles, and was easily covered during the day. My
retinue consisted of three chair-bearers, three
baggage coolies and a useless "boy" whom I had
picked up at Ch'êng-tu and hoped to get rid of
as soon as I could find a suitable man to take his
place. The road led us over the river Ya and
across a great plain almost entirely occupied by
myriads of the dwarf ash-trees which are used in
connection with the production of the famous
white wax. The wax-insects, which are brought
annually in baskets from the Chien-ch'ang valley
south of the Ta Tu, are placed on the branches of
this tree, and in due time proceed to cover themselves
and the branches with a thick coating of
the wax. The branches are then cut off and the
wax carefully removed. The whole process has
been carefully described by Sir Alexander Hosie
in several Foreign Office reports and in his <cite>Three
Years in Western China</cite>.</p>

<p>The inns of Omei-hsien are unusually good,
and as the pilgrim season had not yet begun I
was able to select the best quarters that the city
could provide. Western readers must not suppose
that even the best of Chinese inns would meet
with commendation in England or America. If
in China I am shown into a room that has been
moderately well swept, and possesses a wooden
floor which does not give way, and walls without
holes; that contains a steady table, an unbroken
chair, a window recently papered, and that does
not smell too offensively of stale opium; and if the
room is not next door to the stables and opens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
into a yard that is reasonably clear of garbage and
filth, and is not the common resort of peripatetic
pigs and diseased dogs,&mdash;I then consider that
good fortune has brought me to an inn that may
be described as excellent. The furniture is, of
course, in all cases of the simplest description,
the principal guest-room generally containing only
a table and a couple of chairs. The walls are
either of bare stone or brick, or of mere lath and
plaster. Sometimes they are adorned with a few
hanging scrolls containing "antithetical couplets"
or crude paintings&mdash;probably New Years' gifts to
the landlord from his "foolish younger brothers."
Washing-stands, dressing-tables and side-boards
and similar luxuries are unknown, and the bed
consists either (in north China) of a <i lang="zh">k'ang</i>, which
is built of bricks, or (in the warmer regions) of a
couple of planks placed on trestles. For several
reasons a camp-bed is to Europeans an indispensable
part of even the most modest travelling
equipment. If such are the good inns, what is
to be said of the worst? Earthen floors saturated
with damp and filth and smelling of decaying
refuse; windows from which the paper (glass being,
of course, unknown) has been torn away; tables
which collapse under the weight of the traveller's
frugal dinner unless they are propped up by his
portmanteau and gun-case; roofs from which hang
trailing cobwebs spun by spiders of a vanished
generation; walls of mud through which the
village urchins make holes by the simple pressure
of their grimy fingers; wicked-looking insects of
uncouth shapes that issue at night-time from a
hundred gloomy lurking-places and crawl over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
the edge of one's rice-bowl; an entire lack of
means of illumination except a single sputtering
wick protruding from a saucer filled with rancid
oil: these are but a few of the more obvious discomforts
of many a Chinese hostelry. The inns
of the large towns are with a few exceptions no
better than those of the villages, and often much
less comfortable on account of the greater amount
of noise and dirt. As a rule it is preferable, if
possible, to complete a day's march at a village
rather than in a town; not only for the sake of
quietness and peace, but also because one is less
likely to be disturbed by inquisitive crowds if one
ventures outside the door of the inn.</p>

<p>The people of Omei-hsien, however, are unusually
amiable. Many of them earn their
living by attending to the wants of pilgrims to
the great mountain, and vie with each other in
their efforts to show civility to the stranger within
their gates. Not many Chinese venture to climb
Mount Omei so early in the year as March, as it
is still covered with snow for several thousand
feet of its height; but I observed a large number
of Tibetan pilgrims on their way to and from the
mountain, and ascertained from them that there
was no great difficulty in the ascent. On the
morning of the 7th March, therefore, I left my
servant (who was appalled by the mere shadow
of the mountain) to look after my baggage
in Omei-hsien, and started the ascent in the
company of the two soldiers of my escort. The
town of Omei-hsien lies at 1,500 feet above
sea-level: the summit of the mountain is about
9,500 feet higher.</p>

that carry its story far back into the dim days

<p>It is, indeed, true that "many-fountain'd" Omei
would lose a great part of its spell if the mists
were to melt away into garish daylight. No more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
could the pilgrim pour into the ears of wondering
listeners tales of how, when ascending the mountain
amid gloom and silence, he had suddenly heard
his own praises of the Lord Amitabha re-chanted
by spirit voices; how a rift in the curtain of
white cloud had suddenly disclosed landscapes of
unearthly loveliness, with jewelled palaces and
starry pinnacles such as were never raised by the
hands of men; how he had caught glimpses of
airy forms that passed him with a sigh or a
whisper, but left no traces in the forest or the
snow and made no sound of footfall; or how when
approaching unwittingly the edge of some terrible
abyss he had felt the touch of a ghostly finger
that led him back to safety.</p>

<p>It is believed that the Lolos, who are not
Buddhists, worshipped on Mount Omei a triad of
deities of their own, and it is at least certain that
men of that race are sometimes met on Omei's
slopes. But the earliest legendary associations
of the mountain are in Chinese minds naturally
connected with those mythical progenitors of the
Chinese people&mdash;Fu Hsi and Nü Wo. This
carries us back to the twenty-ninth century <small>B.C.</small>
Both these mysterious persons have their "caves"
on Mount Omei, but they are in such inaccessible
situations that no mortal eye has ever seen them.
The first of the legendary hermits was a holy man
named T'ien Chên Huang Jên,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> the Heavenly
Sage and Imperial Man. He lived in the age
of phœnixes and unicorns; and on Mount Omei
he once received a visit from Huang Ti,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
Yellow Emperor, who flourished in the twenty-sixth
century <small>B.C.</small> Though one of the few of
the world's monarchs who appear to have lived
long enough to celebrate the centenary of their
succession to the throne, Huang Ti wished to
attain the crowning distinction of immortality.
It was to acquire the elixir of life from the
Heavenly Sage that Huang Ti paid him his
memorable visit. A short record of the conversation
between the Sage and his imperial
disciple has been preserved, and we may gather
from it that Huang Ti derived from the interview
a good deal of sound practical advice, but
the Sage seems to have skilfully evaded the
main point. He kept his secret, but made such
excellent personal use of it that he is supposed
to have lived for at least a millennium or two,
and indeed his death has not yet been recorded.
In order to keep count of time he acquired the
useful habit of changing his name with each successive
epoch,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> and his name in the Chou dynasty&mdash;which
occupied the throne about a millennium
and a half after the Yellow Emperor's time&mdash;was
the singularly appropriate one of The Old
Man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MONK OF A THOUSAND YEARS</div>

<p>Omei-shan&mdash;like other sacred mountains in
China&mdash;has always been famous for the medicinal
value of its roots and herbs, and the monks still
derive no little benefit from their sale. Perhaps
it was among these herbs that The Old Man
found his elixir of life, and if so he did not remain
in exclusive possession of the secret. The records<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
of Omei are full of accounts of recluses and others
whose span of life extended far beyond the normal.
One of them is known to legend as Pao Chang,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a>
but more popularly as Ch'ien Sui Ho Shang,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> or
"The Monk of a Thousand Years." The period
of his long and useful life is given in the records.
He was born in the twelfth year of Wei Lieh
Wang of the Chou dynasty, and died in the
eighth year of Kao Tsung of the T'ang dynasty
at the ripe old age of precisely one thousand and
seventy-one. He was a native of India, but came
to China in the Chin dynasty (265-419 of our era)
and went to worship at the shrine of P'u Hsien
Bodhisattva on Mount Omei, where he spent
the declining centuries of his life. According to
another account his arrival at Omei was a good
deal earlier than the Chin period, for his name
is connected with the most famous of all the Omei
stories&mdash;one which refers to the reign of Ming Ti
of the Han dynasty.</p>

<p>This story relates to the foundation of what
may be called the Buddhistic history of Omei and
the beginning of its long religious association with
its patron saint, P'u Hsien Bodhisattva. We are
told that in the reign of Ming Ti (58-75 of
the Christian era) a certain official named P'u<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>
happened to be on Mount Omei looking for
medicinal herbs. In a misty hollow he suddenly
came upon the footprints of a deer. They were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
shaped not like the footprints of an ordinary deer
but like the flower of the lotus. Amazed at
the strange sight, he followed the tracks up the
mountain. They led him continually upwards
until at last he found himself on the summit, and
there, at the edge of a terrible precipice, they
disappeared. As he gazed over the brink he
beheld a sight most strange and wonderful. A
succession of marvellous colours, luminous and
brilliant, gradually rose to the surface of the vast
bank of clouds that lay stretched out below, and
linked themselves together in the form of a glorious
iridescent aureole. P'u, full of wonder at so
extraordinary a spectacle, sought the hermitage of
the famous "Monk of a Thousand Years" and
told him his strange story. "You are indeed
happy!" said the monk. "What you have seen
is no other than a special manifestation to you
of the glory of the great Bodhisattva P'u Hsien:
fitting it is, therefore, that this mountain should
be the centre from which his teachings may be
spread abroad. The Bodhisattva has certainly
favoured you above all men." The end of the
whole matter was that P'u built, on the spot from
which he had witnessed the sublime manifestation,
the first of the Buddhist temples of Mount
Omei, and dedicated it to P'u Hsien Bodhisattva;
and the present monastic buildings known as the
Hsien Tsu Tien and its more modern neighbour
the Chin Tien occupy in the twentieth century the
site chosen for the original P'u Kuang Tien, or
Hall of Universal Glory,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> in the first century.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">LEGENDS</div>

<p>This story is interesting as carrying back the
Buddhistic traditions of Omei to the very earliest
days of Buddhism in China. My readers will
probably remember that it was in the same epoch&mdash;the
reign of Ming Ti&mdash;that the emperor had
his famous vision of the Golden Man, which
is supposed to have led to the introduction of
Buddhism into China under direct imperial patronage.
The story is also of interest as embodying
the first record of the remarkable phenomenon
known as the Glory of Buddha, which has always
been one of the principal attractions of the
mountain and may well have been the real cause&mdash;as
the story itself indicates&mdash;of its special
sanctity.</p>

<p>The other curiosities of Omei are so numerous
that most of them cannot even be referred to.
Near the foot of the mountain is a scooped-out
rock which is said to have once formed a bath
in which pilgrims were required to go through
a course of purification before ascending the
mountain. This, if true, is curious and suggestive.
There is a spot shown where a miraculous lotus-plant&mdash;the
lotus is sacred to the Buddha&mdash;used
to blossom in every season of the year. There
is a flying bell, the tolling of which has been
heard in many different parts of the mountain,
though it is never moved by human hands. There
are rock-inscriptions written by emperors and
empresses and by the great Sung dynasty poet,
Su Tung-p'o. Not far from the Wan-nien
monastery&mdash;perhaps the second oldest on the
mountain&mdash;is a stream called the Black Water.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
In the T'ang dynasty a wandering monk, looking
for a home, came to this stream and wished to
cross it, for he espied on the further bank a spot
which he thought would make an excellent site
for a hermitage. But the stream was turbulent
and violent and he could not cross. Suddenly
out of the midst of the torrent came a huge
tiger. The tiger looked at the monk, and the
monk, unabashed, looked at the tiger. The wild
beast recognised a teacher of the Good Law, and
lay down at his feet, tamed and obedient. The
monk mounted on his back and was carried safely
across the water. The tiger has gone and the
monk has gone, but the story must be true, for
a bridge was built to span the Black Water at
the spot where the miracle occurred, and it is
known as the Tiger Bridge to this day. In
another place there is a great split rock inside
which a mighty dragon slumbered for untold ages.
One night in a terrible thunderstorm the rock
was cleft asunder by lightning. The dragon flew
away and was never seen again, but the story is
true, because the sundered rock is still there and
can be touched.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FAMOUS CAVES AND TREES</div>

<p>The numerous caves on the mountain have
endless stories connected with them. One is
supposed to be the haunt of nine great demons.
Once upon a time some audacious monks determined
that they would probe its mysteries. They
advanced some distance into the interior without
accident, when suddenly they were met by a
prodigious bat that breathed fire. The monks
turned round and walked away, wiser and sadder.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
Another cave&mdash;the Thunder Cavern&mdash;is the haunt
of a ghostly dragon, who lurks in the depths of
a gloomy tarn. This cave, with its lake, has
probably a very ancient history, for it seems to
be associated in some way with animistic worship,
of which there are many traces on Omei.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> In
seasons of drought it is or was formerly the custom
to go to the cave with offerings of rich silks. If
rain did not speedily fall as a result of the offerings,
the correct procedure was to insult the dragon
by throwing into his cave a dead pig and some
articles of a still more disagreeable nature. This
infallibly raised the wrath of the dragon, who
immediately issued forth from his damp and gloomy
home and roared. This meant thunder, and then
the rain fell and all was well.</p>

<p>Mount Omei has several famous trees. Of
one of them this story is told. In the Hui Tsung
period (1101-25) of the Sung dynasty there was a
very old tree, which about the year 1112 was torn
open by a violent storm. Inside it was found
a Buddhist monk, alive, in a state of ecstatic
trance. The whole of his body was covered with
his long hair and whiskers, and his nails were so
long that they encircled his body. The emperor
having heard of this living relic of the past,
directed that he was to be carefully conveyed to
the capital. Having with difficulty induced him
to emerge from his tree, the messenger asked him
his name. "I am the disciple," he replied, "of
Yüan Fa-shih of Tung Lin. My name is Hui
Ch'ih. I came to Omei on pilgrimage and entered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
into meditation in this tree. How is my master
Yuan? Is he well?" "Your master Yuan," said
the imperial emissary, "lived in the time of the
Chin dynasty, and died seven hundred years ago."
Hui Ch'ih answered not a word, but turned his
back and resumed meditation in his tree. A somewhat
similar story is as follows. In the fourteenth
century of our era there was a monk who had
chosen for the scene of his meditations the hollow
interior of an ancient decayed tree. There he sat
cross-legged in silent contemplation until he was
about eighty years of age. His piety apparently
communicated some mysterious vitality to the
tree, for suddenly it underwent an extraordinary
change: the withered branches put forth fresh
shoots, green foliage reappeared, and the gaping
fissure in the trunk closed up, leaving the contemplative
monk inside. The chronicler goes on
to remark with ill-timed levity that the monk had
begun by taking possession of the tree, but the
tree had ended by taking possession of the monk.
It is understood, however, that the accident by
no means interrupted his meditations, and that he
is still sitting cross-legged in the darkened interior
of his sylvan retreat, wrapped in profound reverie.</p>

<p>There is a legend that the Buddha himself
visited Mount Omei, and his footprint in a rock is
still shown near the summit, though in this age of
little faith its outline is scarcely recognisable. As
one of the monasteries also possesses an alleged
Buddha's tooth it is clear that the fame of Omei
ought to be as far-reaching as that of Adam's
Peak and Kandy combined; but Ceylon and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
China are not the only countries that rejoice in
the possession of footprints and teeth of the
Buddha.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MYTHS OF THE PATRON SAINT</div>

<p>The local myths that have gathered round the
name of the patron saint of Omei, P'u Hsien<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>
Bodhisattva, who is said to have brought the
sacred books of Buddhism from India to China
on the back of an elephant, and deposited them
on the mountain, are quite devoid of historical
foundation, for P'u Hsien was merely one of the
numerous figures invented by the Mahayana
Buddhists to fill up the broad canvas of their
vast symbolical system.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> He represents, or rather
is, the Samanta Bhadra of Indian Buddhism, and
figures as such in that great Chinese Buddhist
work, the <i lang="zh">Hua Yen Ching</i>,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> one of the voluminous
productions of Nāgārjuna.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> The monks of Omei
have invented the famous elephant-ride simply
because Samanta Bhadra is always associated with
an elephant in such authoritative Mahayana works
as the Saddharma-Pundarîka. The third last
chapter of that work (in Kumarajiva's translation)
deals with P'u Hsien, who is represented as
declaring to the Buddha that he will "mount a
white elephant with six tusks" and take good
monks under his special protection, shielding them
from gods, goblins and Mara the Evil One. The
monks of Omei say that having come to the
mountain on his elephant he established himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
there as a teacher of the Law of Buddha, and
attracted three thousand pupils or disciples. It
is quite possible that one of the original Buddhist
hermits or monks of Omei acquired so great a
celebrity that he became identified in the popular
imagination with P'u Hsien. Something of the
kind certainly happened in the case of other
Bodhisattvas&mdash;Manjusri and Avalokiteçvara, for
instance. But all trace of historic truth soon
vanished in myth. In a Buddhistic work that
relates to Omei, P'u Hsien is described as the
eldest son of the Buddha himself. "The Tathâgata
(Buddha) sits on a great lotus consisting of 1000
leaves. Each leaf has 3000 Universes. Each
Universe has a Buddha to expound the Law, and
each Buddha has a P'u Hsien as eldest son
(<i lang="zh">changtzŭ</i>)." This is not an attempt to identify
P'u Hsien with Rahula, the son of the historical
Buddha; it refers to the Mahayana doctrine that
Samanta Bhadra or P'u Hsien is the spiritual son
or reflex of the celestial Vairocana, one of the
five mythical Buddhas, just as Gautama Sakyamuni
(the historical Buddha) was supposed to be the
earthly embodiment of the celestial Bodhisattva
Avalokiteçvara, the spiritual son or reflex of
the celestial Buddha Amitabha. As regards the
significance of the elephant, it need only be mentioned
here that in Indian Buddhistic mythology
this animal (apart from its sacred association with
the well-known dream of the Buddha's mother)
is symbolical of self-control.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CHINESE BUDDHISM</div>

<p>The earliest religious buildings on Mount Omei
were no doubt solitary hermitages, erected by recluses
whose religious enthusiasm impelled them
to find in the deep recesses of its forests and gorges
a welcome retreat from the noise and vanity of a
world that they despised. As time went on, richly-endowed
monasteries&mdash;nobler and more splendid
than any now existing&mdash;rose in its silent ravines
and by the side of its sparkling water-courses, and
opened their doors to welcome those whom spiritual
ecstasy or longing for a life of philosophic contemplation,
or perhaps the anguish of defeated
ambition, drove from the haunts of men. But
gradually as religious fervour died away, the
mountain recluses and solitary students of early
days were succeeded by smaller men, distinguished
neither for piety nor for scholarship. It must,
indeed, be confessed that no tradition of sound
learning has been kept up in the Buddhist Church
in China. To some extent the lack of scholarship
among Chinese Buddhists may perhaps be traced
not too fancifully to the practice and teaching of
Bodhidarma,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> the so-called twenty-eighth patriarch
of the Indian Buddhists, and the first of the
patriarchs of China. He it was who, having landed
in China early in the sixth century of our era, at
once made it his business to discourage book-learning
in the monasteries and to inculcate the doctrine
that supreme enlightenment or mystical union with
the Buddha can only be achieved by disregarding
all exoteric teaching and by passive contemplation.
By the recognition of all phenomena, including
one's own personality, as illusory, the mind was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
be maintained in a condition of intellectual quiescence
and receptivity, whereby it would be in a fit
state to enter into communion with the Absolute.
Of Bodhidarma the story is told that he sat for
nine years in one position looking at a wall, which
is a crude way of explaining that he was a contemplative
mystic. In China his teachings have undoubtedly
had a sterilising influence on thought,
somewhat similar&mdash;though for different reasons&mdash;to
the baneful influence exercised in Europe by the
too-exclusive devotion of the mediæval schoolmen
to Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas.</p>

<p>It may seem a far-fetched hypothesis to attribute
part of the present degeneracy of the
Buddhist monkhood in China to the teachings
of a wall-gazing recluse who died nearly fourteen
centuries ago. It might be urged that in searching
for the cause of the present state of decay one
need only point to the low orders of society from
which the monks are recruited, the disfavour with
which Buddhism is and always has been regarded
by the orthodox Confucian, and the contempt
which the thoroughly practical and worldly-minded
Chinese layman almost invariably feels and expresses
for the monastic profession. That these
causes have powerfully assisted in accelerating the
corruption that we witness to-day is unquestionably
true; but there is a good deal of historical
justification for the view that they are results
rather than causes of Buddhist decay, and that
the first and third would never have come into
existence if Buddhism in China had not sunk into
a state of intellectual torpor. If it had retained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
sufficient vigour and independence to reject all
esoteric teachings and alien dogmas, even the
great controversies with Confucianism would probably
never have assumed the bitterness they did.
Unfortunately, the extravagances of the later
Mahayana doctrines and the foolish eclecticism
which led the Buddhist Church to admit into
its own system the crudities and banalities of
corrupt Taoism, rendered the Buddhist position
liable to attack at indefensible points, and compel
us to admit that the controversial victories gained
by Confucianism over its rival were the victories
of light over darkness. It is strange that the
repeated defeats and persecutions of Buddhism in
China have not had the effect of bringing about
either extinction or reform.</p>

<p>Chinese Buddhism is <i lang="la">sui generis</i>, and without
a qualifying adjective it can scarcely be said to be
Buddhism at all. This is no place to attempt a
sketch of the history of that great religion in either
its orthodox or its heretical aspects, but a few
words may be necessary to enable the general
reader to judge for himself whether Buddhism in
China&mdash;quite apart from its present stagnant
condition or the corruption of the monkhood&mdash;is
entitled to the name it bears.</p>

<div class="sidenote">KARMA</div>

<p>If there is one tenet of real Buddhism&mdash;by
which I mean the doctrines on religious, philosophical
and ethical subjects taught or sanctioned
by the historical Buddha&mdash;which is more characteristic
of that system than any other, it is the
doctrine of the non-existence of the <i lang="sa">attā</i> (<i lang="sa">âtman</i>) or
"soul." It was this doctrine, among others, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
made Buddhism a Brahmanical heresy, for it involved
the rejection of the Vedas as the final and
supreme authority on matters of religion. The
crude impression of some people that Buddhism
teaches the "transmigration of souls" is absurd,
for the simple reason that in the Buddhist system
"souls" in the Western sense do not exist. What
survives the death of the individual and transfers
itself to another living being is not his soul but
the cleaving to existence, a <i lang="sa">tanha</i> or thirst for
life, an unconscious&mdash;or semi-conscious&mdash;"will to
live"; and with this <i lang="sa">tanha</i> is inevitably associated
<i lang="sa">karma</i>, the integrated results of action or character.
Buddhism regards the cleaving to existence as the
outcome of the worst kind of ignorance or delusion&mdash;the
mistaking of the phenomenal for the real,
the false for the true; and until this delusion has
been completely removed and the character purified
from all lusts and all evil tendencies, the reintegration
of karma in a world of pain, sorrow, sickness
and death cannot by any possibility be avoided.
Karma,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> apart from its technical connotation, signifies
"action" or "deeds." In the Buddhist sense
it represents the accumulated results of the past
actions and thoughts which every individual has
inherited from countless multitudes of dead men,
and which he will hand on, modified by the newly-generated
karma of his own life-span, to countless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
generations yet unborn. It is karma which forms
the character of each individual, and determines the
condition of life in which he finds himself placed.
The man dies, and his conscious individuality
ceases to be; but his karma continues, and determines
the character and condition of life of another
individual. Each individual may make or mar the
karma that he has inherited: if he spoils it he
may literally sink lower than the beasts; if he
improves it he may literally rise higher than
the gods. But to the Buddhist the final goal to
be aimed at was not a continued personal existence,
either in this world or elsewhere: it was
the total extinction of reproductive karma by the
attainment of Arahatship or Nirvana, and final
release from the ever-circling wheel of existence,
with its endless rotation of birth, disease, sorrow
and death.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">NIRVANA</div>

<p>On the question of a <i lang="la">primum mobile</i>&mdash;the
force which produced the conditions under which
arose the will-to-live with its illusions, and which
brought into being the first appearance of karma<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
&mdash;Buddhism is agnostic or silent,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> just as it is
on the question of the existence of a supreme
God. What Buddhism emphatically teaches is
that karma once produced, continues ceaselessly to
reproduce itself, carrying with it the modifications
impressed upon it by the successive individuals
through whom it has "transmigrated"; that the
only way to release karma from the wheel of phenomenal
existence is to eradicate the desire for a continuance
or renewal of conscious personality; and
that this end can only be attained by following the
Noble Eightfold Path,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> leading to Nirvana, which
was pointed out by the Buddha. Mystical and
fanciful interpretations of the meaning of Nirvana
were forthcoming at an early date, but the canonical
scriptures know nothing of such interpretations.
It is quite clear that Nirvana was not the infinite
prolongation of individual existence in a state of
spiritual beatitude nor an absorption into a pantheistic
Absolute; nor was the word intended to be
a euphemism for death. It was simply a release
from the thraldom of sense and passion; a "blowing-out"
of personality and selfishness, of ignorance
and delusion; an enfranchisement which in
this present life would confer the boon of "the
peace which passeth all understanding," and after
this life would prevent rebirth, or rather reintegration
of karma, in a world of pain and sorrow.
To the Buddhist the whole world of sense, in which
while subject to karma we live and move and have
our being, is an illusion and unreal,&mdash;far more so
than to the Platonist, to whom the phenomenal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
world is the reflexion, though an imperfect one,
of an ideal archetype; and as the early Buddhist
believed that the idea of self or personality was
closely interwoven with the net of illusion, he was
quite consistent when he held that the destruction
of the one must involve the destruction of the
other, and that release from the net is a desirable
consummation. Nirvana may thus be described as
full enlightenment as to the unreality and impermanence
of phenomena, the removal of delusions
about the self, and the eradication of the cleaving to
life. Those who attained this enlightenment were
the saints or "arahats" of primitive Buddhism.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>
The Buddha himself, it must be remembered,
never laid any claim to godhead or even to personal
immortality. His disciples reverenced him
as the Fully Enlightened Sage, the Blessed One,
the Teacher of gods and men, and he was the
expounder of truths by the grasp of which men
would be enabled to realise the condition of arahatship;
but in the last resort it was to themselves
and not to Buddha that men must look
for salvation. "Therefore, O Ananda," said the
Buddha in one of his last discourses, "be ye lamps
unto yourselves. Be ye a refuge to yourselves.
Betake yourselves to no external refuge. Hold
fast to the truth as a lamp. Hold fast as a refuge
to the truth. Look not for refuge to any one
besides yourselves."<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">AMITABHISM</div>

<p>How vastly different are the teachings of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
Chinese Buddhists from those of the simple
creed promulgated by the Buddha is obvious to
all who have visited a Chinese monastery, or
glanced at the wearisome sutras, in which the
unorthodox dogmas are so elaborately set forth.
The Brahmanical belief in the <i lang="sa">âtman</i> or "soul" is
practically reintroduced; arahatship is no longer
the ideal to be aimed at by the virtuous man;
Nirvana ceases to have any intelligible meaning;
faith takes the place of works as a means to salvation.
Celestial (Dhyâni) Buddhas are invented as
heavenly reflexes of the various human Buddhas
that are supposed to have lived on earth, and some
of them receive worship as immortal gods; arahats
are regarded as inferior to a class of mythical
Bodhisattvas, who purposely refrain from entering
into the state of Buddhahood in order that they
may continue to exercise a beneficent influence
among the beings who are still bound to the
wheel of existence; the most glorious lot attainable
by the ordinary man is held to be not a
release from delusion and the pains of birth, sickness,
and death, but a final rebirth in the glittering
Paradise of the West. In this Paradise reigns the
Lord of Eternal Life and Boundless Light, the
great Dhyâni Buddha Amitabha; on his right and
left are enthroned the Bodhisattvas Mahâsthâma
and Avalokiteçvara,<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> the lords of infinite strength<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
and pity, the saviours of mankind. To win utter
happiness in Sukhâvatî, the Western Paradise, is
the object of the longings and prayers of the
devout Chinese Buddhist. The name of Sakyamuni
Buddha means little to him, and he may
even be ignorant of who the Buddha was, and
where he lived; but the names of "O-mi-to-fo"
(Amitabha Buddha)<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> and of Kuan Yin P'u Sa
(the Bodhisattva Avalokiteçvara) stand to him
for everything that is holiest and most blissful.
To such an extent have Amitabha and his attendant
Bodhisattvas taken the place of the "Three
Refuges"<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> of orthodox Buddhism that one almost
feels justified in suggesting that the prevailing
(though not the only) form of Buddhism in China
should once and for all be differentiated from that
of Burma and Ceylon, by the adoption of the
name of Amitabhism, just as the corrupt religion
of Tibet has rightly been given the special name
of Lamaism.</p>

<p>If the Mahayana teachers in China had been
satisfied with substituting the doctrine of a more
or less sensual heaven for that of the orthodox
arahatship or Nirvana on the ground that it was
more suited to the comprehension of the ordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
layman, and would be more effective in teaching
the people to lead virtuous lives, their distortion of
the early teachings might, perhaps, to some extent
be justified; but unfortunately the form which the
new doctrine took at a very early stage shows that
no such theory was in their minds. Instead of
exhorting to strenuous lives of virtue and good
works, they went out of their way to teach that
nothing was really necessary to salvation but loud
and frequent appeals to the name of Amitabha
Buddha and zealous repetitions of the appropriate
sutras. One of the principal sutras of this class
contains the following emphatic statement:&mdash;"Beings
are not born in that Buddha country
of the Tathâgata Amitâyus as a reward and result
of good works performed in this present life.
No, whatever son or daughter of a family shall
hear the name of the blessed Amitâyus, the
Tathâgata, and having heard it, shall keep it in
mind, and with thoughts undisturbed shall keep
it in mind for one, two, three, four, five, six or
seven nights,&mdash;when that son or daughter of a
family comes to die, then that Amitâyus, the
Tathâgata, surrounded by an assembly of disciples
and followed by a host of Bodhisattvas, will stand
before them at their hour of death, and they will
depart this life with tranquil minds. After their
death they will be born in the world Sukhâvatî, in
the Buddha country of the same Amitâyus, the
Tathâgata. Therefore, then, O Sâriputra, having
perceived this cause and effect, I with reverence
say thus, Every son and every daughter of a
family ought with their whole mind to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
fervent prayer for that Buddha country."<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> Numerous
Buddhist tracts are in existence and widely
circulated among the people, in which it is explicitly
stated that if a man calls sufficiently often
on the name of Kuan Yin, he will be delivered
from any danger or difficulty in which he may be
placed, quite regardless of his deserts. There are
popular stories in which it is told that even if a
man be guilty of grave crimes for which he has
been imprisoned and condemned to death, the
knife of the executioner will break in pieces and
do him no hurt provided only he has, with a believing
heart, summoned to his aid the "Goddess of
Mercy." Stories of this kind, even if educated
men do not believe in them, can hardly have
a beneficent effect upon morality, and hardly
redound to the credit of the monks who invented
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">KUAN YIN</div>

<p>To blame the Chinese Buddhists, however, for
failing to preserve their religion from corrupt influences
is hardly fair: for it must be admitted
that the stream of Buddhist literature and tradition
that flowed for centuries into China from Northern
India and Nepal issued from a source that was
already tainted. Sakyamuni Buddha probably died
in the fifth century <small>B.C.</small> Buddhism did not obtain
a foothold in China till five or six centuries later,
and it was not till the fourth century of our era
that native Chinese began in large numbers to take
the vows as Buddhist monks. By this time primitive
Buddhism had already been cruelly distorted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
Where it was at all possible, the Mahayana dogmas
were read into the simple scriptures that formed
the Asokan canon; where the utmost ingenuity
failed to find the germs of these dogmas in
the canon, the doctors of the Mahayana school
deliberately set themselves to compile a series of
colossal forgeries by putting forth new sutras,
purporting to have been uttered by the Buddha
himself, but containing an entirely new book of
doctrine.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> Part of it was probably brought from
Persia and Arabia, and nearly all was totally
inconsistent with the primitive doctrine of the
Buddha. Like the founder of the Mormons in
after-ages, the pious forgers&mdash;let us hope they
were unconscious of their guilt&mdash;pretended to be
merely the "finders" of the new sutras. Sometimes
they were said to have been discovered in
caves guarded by demons. Nāgārjuna, for instance,
who was one of the worst offenders, is supposed
to have found in "the palace of the Dragon"
the great Hua Yen sutra, already referred to, a
work which justifies us in regarding Nāgārjuna as
one of the principal inventors or adapters of the
Mahayana doctrines, or at least as one of those who
grafted them on the original Buddhistic stock.
The Chinese admire him so much that they have
elevated him into the position of a Bodhisattva,
and celebrate his birthday on the 25th day of the
seventh moon. Among the principal speakers in
the Hua Yen sutra are the Buddha himself and
the mythical Bodhisattvas P'u Hsien and Manjusri.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MAHAYANA</div>

<p>The Mahayana doctrine concerning this order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
of being is, as I have said, totally unknown to
early Buddhism; and out of or beside this central
doctrine of the Mahayana system grew up a
cluster of dogmas which, like some parasitic weed,
could only have the effect of choking and killing
the original plant of which the Buddha himself
had sown the seed. The Chinese "fathers"
were not primarily responsible for all this. The
vast mythology that culminates in the doctrine
of Amitabha's heaven was accepted in China only
too readily, but it was not a Chinese invention.
If the history of these fanciful dogmas can be
more readily traced in China and Tibet than
elsewhere, it is only because Buddhism practically
ceased to exist in the country of its origin. What
Chinese Buddhism might have been if it had
sought to establish itself upon the Asokan canon
instead of upon a bundle of crude myths and
grotesque allegories may be realised easily enough
by comparing it with the Buddhism of Burma
and Siam, which&mdash;in spite of their tolerance of a
system of animistic worship alien to Buddhism&mdash;have
preserved almost intact the body of doctrine
that they inherited through Ceylon from the
orthodox Church. What with the growth of
the mystic schools derived from Bodhidarma,
the Tantra schools with their magic spells and
incantations, the Lin Tzŭ school that teaches
religion in the form of enigmas, the Wu Wei
school with its doctrine of a Golden Mother, the
hideous demonology introduced into Buddhism
by a debased wonder-working Taoism, and the
innumerable schools that unite in their praises<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
of the bejewelled Western Heaven which can
be attained merely by repeating the name of
Amitabha Buddha or Kuan Yin P'u Sa, it is no
wonder that Buddhism in China has fallen a
victim to the fangs of its own grotesque offspring.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHRISTIAN MISSIONS</div>

<p>In the following chapter some further remarks
on Mount Omei will, I trust, serve to emphasise
the observations already made, and will perhaps
help the European reader who has not visited
China to form some conception of the theory
and practice of Chinese Buddhism at the present
day. I hope I may be excused if I depart so
far from the usual practice of travellers in China
as to refrain from entering into a discussion of
the general question of religion, especially in
connection with Christian propaganda. For my
own part, I may perhaps venture to express the
hope and belief that the missionary question is
one which time will solve at no very distant date.
As soon as a reformed China has earned for herself&mdash;by
the reform of her legal codes and judicial
procedure&mdash;the right to demand the total abolition
of foreign consular jurisdiction within Chinese
territory, missionaries will cease to be a thorn in
the flesh of Chinese officialdom. They may obtain
fewer converts, but they will at least have the satisfaction
of knowing that such converts as they may
then gain will not be actuated by the desire to
secure foreign protection against the laws of their
own country; whereas the official classes will no
longer have cause to regard missionaries as a
political danger. There is no doubt that many of
the outbreaks of fanatical hatred against foreigners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
are directly or indirectly traceable to the missionary
question.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> In spite of this fact it will be generally
conceded that, like most Orientals, the Chinese
are, in purely religious matters, inclined to be
extremely tolerant: far more so, needless to say,
than Western peoples usually are. History proves
that the Chinese people are not hostile to foreign
religious doctrines as such, but only when
foreign religions tend to introduce disintegrating
forces into the social fabric. Similarly the official
classes are not inimical to foreign religions as
such, but only when foreign religions threaten
the stability of the political fabric and the
independence of the State. These dangers will
no longer operate when foreign missionary enterprise
absolutely ceases to have even the semblance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
of a connection with international politics, and
foreign missionaries become in all respects amenable
to the courts of the country in which
they live and work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RELIGION IN CHINA</div>

<p>Whether the change will
tend to spread the doctrines of Christianity in
China with greater rapidity, or will, on the other
hand, bring about its ultimate extinction, is a
question regarding which it would be rash to
prophesy. Given fair field and no favour it
might well seem that the disorganised forces of
a corrupt Buddhism would be ill fitted to cope
with such strenuous and well-equipped adversaries
as the Churches of Christendom: yet perhaps it
is more likely that the ultimate victory will rest
with neither. The clashing of forces that must
assuredly result from the weakening of the hold
of Confucianism on the educated classes and the
introduction of new political and social ideals
may lead to an intellectual upheaval tending to
the destruction of all religion. Even to-day,
the only vigorous element in the heterogeneous
religious systems of China consists in that expansion
of the ideal of filial piety which takes the
form of the cult of ancestors: a cult which has
done so much in the past to preserve, consolidate
and multiply the Chinese people and make them
peaceful, law-abiding and home-loving, and which
has nevertheless been condemned as idolatrous by
the two great branches of the Christian faith. It
was this rock of Chinese orthodoxy that shattered
the power of the Church of Rome in China, and
that rock is still a danger and an obstruction in
the troubled waters through which glide the frail<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
barks of the Christian missions. On the whole,
it seems improbable that the dogmas, at least, of
any of the Christian Churches will ever find
general acceptance on Chinese soil. The moral
and spiritual regeneration of China is more likely
to be brought about by the growth of a neo-Confucianism
frankly accepting such adaptations
as the social and political conditions of modern
times may render necessary; and if this is insufficient
to satisfy the spiritual aspirations of the
people, there may arise a reformed Buddhism
drawing its inspiration either from the simple
faith of Burma, Siam, and Ceylon, or&mdash;far more
probably&mdash;from one of the complex systems (near
in kinship to those of China but with a vitality
of their own) that have evolved themselves upon
the soil of Japan.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

<p class="center">MOUNT OMEI</p>

<div class="sidenote">BUDDHIST MONASTERIES</div>

<p>Very few of the buildings now existing on
Mount Omei can boast of antiquity, for a damp
climate and the ravages of fire have in the past
made short work of their fragile timbers. The
monasteries are humble structures, being simply
one-storied bungalows of wood. Compared with
the richly-carved teakwood <i lang="my">wats</i> of Siam and
<i lang="my">kyaungs</i> of Burma, they are unpretentious buildings
with little decoration, and what there is
possesses small artistic merit. Over the doorways
and under the eaves hang sundry massive
wooden boards, resplendent with richly-gilded
characters, giving the name of the monastery
and brief quotations from the Buddhist scriptures.
Most of the tablets containing inscriptions or
quotations have been presented by devout
pilgrims, but the periodical regilding of the
characters is paid for out of the corporate funds.
The interiors are generally more imposing; for
every monastery on Mount Omei is also a temple,
and the decoration of the halls containing the
images of the Buddha and his saints is generally
on a fairly lavish scale. The larger temples have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
a series of such halls one behind the other, with
courts or quadrangles intervening, the sides of
each quadrangle being occupied by the monks'
living quarters. There are also spacious quarters
for visitors. The office in which the financial
and other secular affairs of the monastery are
administered is generally a small room on the
left side of the first hall of images, corresponding
to a room on the other side which is used as a
kind of porter's lodge. In the latter room the
monks spend a great deal of their time in the
cold weather, and sit huddled round a charcoal
brazier. From the middle of the room they can
see, through the open door, every one who enters
and leaves the temple by the main entrance; and
one of them is generally deputed to attend on
every group of visitors or pilgrims. All pilgrims
bring their own food with them&mdash;the Chinese
their rice, and the Tibetans their <i lang="bo">tsamba</i>; but
those whose appearance entitles them to respect,
or who have given a substantial donation to the
funds of the establishment, are invited to drink
tea and eat sweetmeats, and warm themselves by
the charcoal fire. The Buddhistic injunction to
avoid taking life is rigorously obeyed on Mount
Omei by visitors as well as residents, all of whom
conform to a strictly vegetarian diet. The only
persons who ever disregard this rule are some
inconsiderate Europeans. Small subscriptions&mdash;generally
in the form of copper "cash"&mdash;are
placed on an offertory plate, or on the altar table
in front of one of the principal images, and are
deposited there by the pilgrims after they have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
finished their devotions. Those who wish to leave
a permanent record of their visit, or whose donation
exceeds a <i>tael</i> (say three shillings), inscribe
their names or paste their cards in the subscription
book, with a statement of the amount of
their donations. An ingenious plan has been
devised to relieve pilgrims of the necessity of
carrying large quantities of coin up the mountain,
and at the same time to invalidate excuses of
want of money. In the town of Omei-hsien,
where every pilgrim spends the night before
beginning the ascent, he is visited by a banker
or broker, who offers him little paper notes or
chits called <i lang="zh">fei tzŭ</i>, bearing various face-values
from ten taels down to one hundred cash (about
twopence). They are printed from wooden
blocks, and in many cases the amount of money
represented is inserted in writing. The pilgrim
selects as many <i lang="zh">fei tzŭ</i> as he thinks he may
require or can afford, and pays over their face-value
to the banker. The notes are handed as
occasion requires, or benevolence prompts, to the
temple treasurers, or are deposited on the altars,
and are received in the temples as readily as
coin. When a considerable collection of them
has been made in any monastery they are sent
down to the banker, who deducts his very small
commission and settles the account either by
sending silver in return, or by crediting the
monastery with the amount in his books.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MONASTIC ENDOWMENTS</div>

<p>The monasteries naturally vary in size. Some
of them are the homes of a score or more of
monks and acolytes, while the smaller ones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
shelter but three or four. When a monastery is
destroyed by fire or other cause, its elderly or
infirm inmates lodge themselves temporarily in
one of the neighbouring religious houses, while
the more energetic go forth on a pilgrimage&mdash;sometimes
as far as the Eastern sea-board&mdash;carrying
with them a donation book for the
purpose of collecting funds for rebuilding. When
the monastery arises again from its ashes it is
practically a new foundation with new endowments,
even its name being sometimes altered.
In spite of the apathy concerning religious matters
that strikes every European observer as characteristic
of China to-day, it is a significant fact
that large subscriptions for religious purposes can
always be obtained from the Chinese layman notwithstanding
his protestations of contempt for
the monastic ideal and for the idle and useless
lives led by the vast majority of Chinese Buddhist
monks.</p>

<p>Passing by the Pao-ning monastery, which
is situated on the plain between the city and
the mountain-base, I visited the monasteries of
the White Dragon (Pai Lung Ssŭ), and the
Golden Dragon (Chin Lung Ssŭ), and stopped
for the night at the Wan-nien Ssŭ, formerly the
White Water Monastery of P'u Hsien. This is
one of the largest establishments on the mountain,
and its written history goes back to the third
century, if not further. It contains many objects
of interest, the chief of which is the life-size
bronze elephant discovered, or rather first described,
by Baber. The very curious spiral-roofed brick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
building in which it stands&mdash;believed by Baber to
have been erected by Hindu Buddhists not later
than the sixth century of the Christian era&mdash;is
unfortunately so small and shut in that it is impossible
either to photograph the elephant or to
view it from a proper standpoint. Baber believed
that this edifice was, next to the Great Wall,
the oldest building in China of fairly authentic
antiquity, and he considered that the elephant
was the most ancient bronze casting of any great
size in existence,&mdash;perhaps fifteen centuries old.
I have some reason, however, to doubt the alleged
antiquity of both building and elephant.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> Upon
the animal's back is a bronze statue of P'u Hsien
P'u Sa (Samanta Bhadra Bodhisattva), who, as I
have said, is supposed to have come from India
to Mount Omei on an elephant. Among modern
curiosities at the Wan-nien Ssŭ is a small alabaster
image of Gautama Buddha, which was recently
brought from Burma by a Chinese Buddhist monk
who had been on pilgrimage to the shrines of
Mandalay and Rangoon. The same pilgrim presented
a coloured print of the great Shwe Dagon
pagoda at Rangoon, which is regarded by the
monks of Wan-nien as a precious work of art,
though its intrinsic value is, of course, trifling.
There is also, in a separate building called the
Hai Hui T'ang,<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> a supposed tooth-relic of Buddha,
which is treated with strange lack of reverence.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a>
But it is only an elephant's molar, and the monks
know it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">FLORA OF MOUNT OMEI</div>

<p>Wan-nien Ssŭ is situated at a height of
about 3,500 feet above the sea-level. The summit
of the mountain (11,000 feet<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a>) is therefore still a
long way off; but as I succeeded in reaching it
on the evening of the day on which I left Wan-nien
Ssŭ, in spite of the fact that the path was
often obliterated by snow and ice, I satisfied
myself that the difficulty of the climb has often
been much exaggerated. In dry weather, indeed,
there is no reason why a healthy man of average
physical vigour should not accomplish in one day
the whole climb from base to summit: though
such a feat of endurance would prevent him from
paying much attention to the objects of interest
on the way. The mountain sides are luxuriantly
wooded, and it is only when the path approaches
the edge of a precipice or a steep slope that
any extensive view can be obtained during the
greater part of the ascent. The silver fir, evergreen-oak,
pine, cypress, laurel, birch, chestnut,
spruce, <i lang="zh">nan-mu</i>, maple (several species) and <i lang="la">camptotheca
acuminata</i> are all to be met with, and
there are innumerable flowering plants and ferns;
but the character of the flora naturally varies a
great deal at the different altitudes. On the
exposed parts of the summit there is little
but dwarf bamboos, junipers and rhododendrons,
though in sheltered places I noticed the silver
fir, liquidambar, yew, willow, pirus, and several
kinds of shrubs. Other trees, like the alder,
Chinese ash, and banyan, are confined to the plain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
or to the lower slopes. The banyans<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> of the
Omei plain are magnificent trees, some of them
of enormous girth.</p>

<p>Below Wan-nien Ssŭ I left behind me
spring warmth and sprouting vegetation. By the
time I had reached a height of 4,000 feet there
were patches of snow on the roadside; 2,000 feet
higher all visible trace of the path was gone,
icicles hung from the leafless trees, while small
acolytes from the monasteries, clad in their wadded
winter garments, were busily sweeping away the
snow in front of the gateways. When I left
Omei-hsien my thermometer registered 64° Fahr.
At Wan-nien Ssŭ the temperature had sunk to
49°; on the summit of the mountain there were
13 degrees of frost after sunset.</p>

<p>The next temple to Wan-nien Ssŭ is the
Kuan Hsin Ting,<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> a poor building which was
apparently in sole charge of a child of nine. The
next is the Hsi Hsin So.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> These words may
be interpreted as "The Haven of the Tranquil
Heart," but they also mean "The Pilgrim's
Rest," for <i lang="zh">hsi hsin</i> are the words used to translate
or explain the Sanskrit term <i lang="sa">sramana</i>,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> an
ascetic or monk. The records of the mountain
explain the name by saying that when the pilgrim
reaches this place, he can no longer hear the
growlings and mutterings of the "dusty world":
his heart therefore becomes as peaceful as his
surroundings. In the building is a large image
of Maitrêya, the "Buddha of the Future," who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
is supposed to be in the Tushita heaven, awaiting
incarnation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARAHATSHIP</div>

<p>Passing by the Ch'ang Lao P'ing<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> temple,
the next is the Ch'u Tien,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> otherwise known as
the Tsu Tien. <i lang="zh">Tsu</i> is a kind of red-eyed duck,
and the allusion is to the duck-like shape of a
neighbouring rock. The temple contains rather
life-like images of the eighteen <i lang="zh">lo-han</i>.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> These
Chinese words represent the Sanskrit <i lang="sa">arhat</i> or
<i lang="sa">arahat</i>, "venerable" or "worthy." We meet
with arhats in the oldest Buddhist scriptures.
They were the worthiest and most enlightened
of Buddha's disciples; men who fully understood
the doctrine as it was delivered to them by their
master, and accepted it as a final statement of truth.
Arahatship, as we have seen in the last chapter, is
the goal aimed at by all true Buddhists, and implies
a release from all delusion, ignorance and sorrow.
In technical language the arahat is the man who
has acquired the "four distinctive qualifications"
(<i lang="sa">patisambhidâ</i>) and has attained the state of "final
sanctification." In the hands of the Mahayanists
the arahats come to be persons possessing magical
powers,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> such as that of moving without support
through space, in which respect they are the
nearest approach to the mysterious Tibetan beings
invented by the self-styled "theosophists": but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
arahatship as an ideal becomes altogether subordinate
to that of Bodhisattship, the state of the holy
man who, having arrived at the stage next preceding
that of Buddhahood, voluntarily refrains from
taking the final step, in order that he may remain
as a teacher and saviour among men. In the
Chinese Buddhistic system there are several classifications
of the arahats or <i lang="zh">lo-han</i>: we find them in
groups of twelve hundred, five hundred, eighteen
and sixteen. The twelve hundred are only met
with, so far as I am aware, in books; but many
large temples in China contain images of the
five hundred. In Canton, for example, there is
what Europeans have rather foolishly named the
Hall of the Five Hundred Genii. Some wag once
fancied he saw a resemblance in one of the figures
there to Marco Polo, and for some reason or other
the idea struck the professional Canton guides as
such a happy one that for many years past they
have been in the habit of deluding thousands of
European and American travellers with the belief
that Messer Marco has been turned into a
Chinese "god." The mistake assumes a somewhat
grotesque character when we remember that,
according to the Chinese belief, each of the five
hundred lo-han is destined at some remote period
to become a Buddha.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> In the majority of Chinese
temples&mdash;as in those of Mount Omei&mdash;the number
of lo-han represented by images is only eighteen;
but there is a difference of opinion among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
followers of different schools as to the identity of
two of these. In Korea and Japan the temples
generally contain sixteen lo-han, while Tibetan
Lamaism sometimes recognises sixteen and sometimes
eighteen.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> The two extra ones seem to
have been added as an after-thought by Chinese
Buddhists in comparatively modern times.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LOTUS-FLOWER</div>

<p>Above the Temple of the Red-eyed Duck
comes the Hua Yen Ting.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> As already mentioned,
the name <i lang="zh">Hua Yen</i> is that of a famous sutra
"discovered" by Nāgārjuna. The temple contains
the eighteen lo-han and figures of Sakyamuni
Buddha and the two Bodhisattvas P'u Hsien and
Manjusri.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> Behind these three central figures is
a small Kuan Yin (Avalokiteçvara). On leaving
this temple the road strikes downwards for a short
distance, and, soon after recommencing the ascent,
we arrive next at the monastery known as the
Lien Hua Shih<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> ("Lotus Flower Stone"), where
there is a holy relic consisting of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>curiously shaped
stone from which the place derives its
name. I found a number of Tibetan pilgrims
rubbing coins on it; the coins to be afterwards
carefully preserved as charms. The stone is said
by the monks (on no authority that I can discover)
to have been brought up from deep waters by
miraculous agency, and to have floated on the
surface like the flower of the lotus. The lotus
myth in Buddhist cosmology is based on a very
picturesque allegory, with which most of my
readers are probably acquainted. Its meaning
has been accurately described in the following
words by E. J. Eitel, who, though he possesses
the usual bias against "heathendom," is a fairly
sympathetic writer on Buddhist subjects. "The
idea conveyed in this flowery language of Buddhism
is of highly poetic and truly speculative import,
amounting to this: that as a lotus flower, growing
out of a hidden germ beneath the water, rises up
slowly, mysteriously, until it suddenly appears
above the surface and unfolds its buds, leaves,
and pistils, in marvellous richness of colour and
chastest beauty of form; thus also, in the system
of worlds, each single universe rises into being,
evolved out of a primitive germ, the first origin
of which is veiled in mystery, and finally emerges
out of the chaos, gradually unfolding itself, one
kingdom of nature succeeding the other, all forming
one compact whole, pervaded by one breath,
but varied in beauty and form. Truly an idea,
so far removed from nonsense, that it might
be taken for an utterance of Darwin himself."<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
Visitors to Buddhist temples cannot fail to observe
how frequently the lotus allegory has been made
to subserve religious and artistic purposes, and we
have seen in the last chapter how it has been
associated with the story of the beginning of P'u
Hsien's worship on Mount Omei. The images of
the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are nearly always
represented as sitting or standing in the centre of
a huge open lotus, and even P'u Hsien's elephant
stands on the same sacred plant.</p>

<p>As regards the stone in the Lien Hua monastery,
I may add that it does not bear the smallest
resemblance to a lotus or any other plant, and
apparently it is not supposed to do so. Its
original crude shape has evidently never been
tampered with, though its surface has been worn
smooth by constant rubbing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"OM MANE PADME HOM"</div>

<p>Into the same temple another stone&mdash;not a
sacred one&mdash;has found its way. It is a huge
boulder, many tons in weight, that was brought
down the mountain side some years ago by an
avalanche, and crashed into the back of the main
hall, where, for superstitious reasons&mdash;and perhaps
because its removal would be a matter of immense
difficulty&mdash;it has been allowed to remain. On a
hanging scroll above the central images I noticed a
Chinese transliteration<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> of the well-known Tibetan
formula, "<i lang="bo">Om Mane Padme Hom</i> (or <i lang="zh">Hung</i>),"<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a>
generally translated&mdash;but this is a controversial
matter&mdash;"Hail! The Jewel in the Lotus." The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
first word <i>Om</i> or <i>Aum</i> is the well-known sacred
syllable of Brahmanism; practically it is simply
a <i lang="la">syllaba invocationis</i>. The Jewel may mean the
Buddha, or his Law (Dharma), or the Buddhist
Church (Sangha), or all three combined, or more
probably signifies Avalokiteçvara (the Chinese
Kuan Yin and Japanese Kwannon), who in
Lamaism is supposed to be incarnated in every
successive Grand Lama. But, as a matter of
fact, very few of the Tibetans who mutter the
sentence as they walk or turn it in their prayer-wheels,
or carve it on stones and rocks by the
wayside, can give any clear idea of what they
mean by it. Like the Chinese <i lang="zh">Nam-Mo</i> (or
<i lang="zh">Nan-Wu</i>) <i lang="zh">O-mi-to-Fo</i><a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> ("Praise be to Amitabha
Buddha"), it is regarded as a kind of <i lang="sa">dhâranî</i> or
mystic spell, the constant repetition of which will
lead the believer to a life of bliss in Sukhâvatî,
the Western Paradise. The only Chinese whom
I met on the mountain besides the residents
were Buddhist monks on pilgrimage, and the
invocation to Amitabha was constantly on their
lips; the other was repeated with equal persistence
by the Tibetan pilgrims. During part of
my climb the mountain was enveloped in a thick
mist, which muffled the sound of footsteps; but
there was seldom a moment that I did not hear
one or other of these mystic sentences floating
weirdly in the air above me or below.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WHITE CLOUDS MONASTERY</div>

<p>A steep climb soon brought me to the Hsi
Hsiang Ch'ih<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> ("The Elephant's Bath"), where a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
temple has been built close to a pool of water
where P'u Hsien's famous elephant is said to
have bathed after his long journey. The temple
contains images of Sakyamuni Buddha, P'u Hsien
and Manjusri. Behind them, in the same hall,
are three beautifully gilded figures, larger than
life-size, representing Amitabha Buddha attended
by Kuan Yin and Ta Shih Chih<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> Bodhisattvas.
These are the three beings who are supposed to
preside over the Western Paradise; their images
are therefore frequently found together, Amitabha
always in the centre. In another hall is an image
of Kuan Yin unattended.</p>

<p>The next temple is known as the Great
Vehicle<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> or Mahayana monastery. Here are
images of Sakyamuni, Manjusri and P'u Hsien,
who are also constantly associated in this
manner; and behind them, facing in the opposite
direction, is a large Maitrêya, the Coming Buddha.
After a fairly steep ascent thence and a short
descent the path rises to the Pai Yün Ku Ch'a<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a>
("The Old Monastery of the White Clouds")&mdash;which
at the time of my visit I found to be a
most appropriate name. Here there is a colossal
sedent image of Chang Liang,<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> a warlike hero
who died in the second century of our era, after
he had made an ineffectual attempt to achieve
immortality by starving himself. He was subsequently
canonised by the name of Wên Ch'êng.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a>
In another hall are Sakyamuni Buddha, Manjusri
and P'u Hsien, supported by the eighteen lo-han.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
In ascending to the next temple, the Lei Tung
P'ing,<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> all pilgrims are expected to preserve
absolute silence. The Lei Tung or Thunder
Cavern is that which shelters the irascible Dragon
of rain and thunder, to whom I referred in the
last chapter. An inscription that hangs in the
temple apparently refers to his controlling powers
over lightning and rain-clouds.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> The slightest
sound of the human voice, either in laughter or
in speech, is liable to produce a terrific whirlwind
and thunderstorm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TEMPLE OF THE PRINCE ROYAL</div>

<p>Next above this perilous locality comes the
Chieh Yin Tien<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a>&mdash;the Temple of Amitabha.
The words <i lang="zh">chieh yin</i> mean "to receive and lead,"
and are applied to Amitabha because he it is
who is supposed to assist the faithful to reach the
Western Heaven in which he reigns. The first
hall contains a richly-gilded colossal statue of this
Buddha, standing upright. Behind him is a figure
of Wei To<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> (<i lang="sa">Vêda</i>), a Bodhisattva who is regarded
as a <i lang="sa">vihârapâla</i>, or tutelary deity of the Buddhist
monkhood. He is responsible for seeing that the
recluses do not suffer through lack of nourishment,
and that the monastery is properly supplied
with necessaries. The second hall contains the
eighteen lo-han in bronze. There are also the
usual images of Sakyamuni and his attendant
Bodhisattvas, and a colossal gilded P'u Hsien
sitting on a lotus on the back of a white elephant.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
In the right-hand corner of this well-populated
hall is another triad of divinities: Yo Shih Fo,<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a>
a mythical Buddha who dwells in an eastern
world, with Ti Tsang and Kuan Yin Bodhisattvas
on his left and right. This is a favourite Buddha
in China, and is supposed to hold in the East a
position somewhat analogous to that of Amitabha
in the West. In the popular imagination he has
replaced the Motionless (<i lang="zh">wu tung</i>) Buddha Akchôbhya
(A-ch'u-p'o) and is worshipped as the healer
of sickness. Ti Tsang<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> is one of the great Bodhisattvas,
like P'u Hsien, Ta Shih Chih and Manjusri.
The principal seat of his worship in China is in the
province of Anhui. He is the benevolent being
who seeks to save human beings from the punishments
of hell. His prototype is said to have been
a Siamese prince.</p>

<p>A steep ascent from this interesting monastery
leads to the Ku T'ai Tzŭ P'ing,<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> the "Ancient
Temple of the Prince Royal." It is said that
this building is named after a prince of the Ming
dynasty, but the monks of to-day prefer to regard
the T'ai Tzŭ as Sakyamuni Buddha himself, in
the character of Prince Siddharta, son of the king
of Kapilavastu. The figure representing him is
attired in real robes, richly embroidered. On his
right is P'u Hsien, seated on a white tuskless
elephant. As already mentioned, P'u Hsien's
elephants are generally characterised by their six<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
tusks. On the prince's left is Kuan Yin; and
behind these three central figures are images of Ti
Tsang, Ta Shih Chih, Wên Ch'êng (Chang Liang)
and Manjusri, all of whom have been described.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TAOIST DIVINITIES</div>

<p>The next is the Yung-ch'ing Ssŭ<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> or Eternal
Happiness monastery. Here a many-armed Kuan
Yin faces the entrance, and behind him (or her) is
an Amitabha. The only new figure among the
rest is that of Bodhidarma or Ta-mo, the St
Thomas of the Catholic missionaries.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> He sits
cross-legged with the first finger of the right hand
raised. A small P'u Hsien is seated on an
elephant with four tusks, the other two being lost.
In this hall I observed some heaps of broken
statues in bronze and iron, the remains of a ruined
temple. From here a level path leads to the K'ai
Shan Jou Shên Tsu Shih Tien,<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> which, as the name
partly indicates, contains a gruesome relic in the
shape of the mummified body of a former abbot,
attired in the robes he wore in life. The dried
shrunken face has been lacquered with great
care, and no one would guess that the figure
was not made of clay or bronze. It is not the
only mummy on the mountain. From here a
short steep path leads to the Eagle-wood Pagoda,<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a>
a monastery named after a miniature nine-storied
bronze pagoda, the gift of a Ming empress. The
next temple bears the imposing inscription of "The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
August Guard of the Gate of Heaven,"<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> where
there is a large Sakyamuni with the usual attendant
Bodhisattvas. Next comes the Ch'i T'ien
Ch'iao<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a>&mdash;The Bridge of the Seventh Heaven&mdash;where
there is a small temple in which the three
Bodhisattvas&mdash;P'u Hsien (in the middle) and
Manjusri and Kuan Yin (on the right and left)&mdash;sit
in a row in front of a solitary image of Sakyamuni.
The next temple is the P'u Hsien Pagoda,<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> where
the patron saint of Mount Omei, as is natural,
occupies the place of honour in the middle of
the hall facing the entrance. Behind him is
Amitabha, and at the back of the hall, right
and left, are Sakyamuni and Kuan Yin. On the
left side of the hall is an image of one of the
favourite personages in the Chinese theogony&mdash;Ts'ai
Shên, the "God of Wealth."<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> This god
is so popular in China that Buddhism could not
afford to neglect him, but as he is really a Taoist
divinity he is only allowed to appear in a Buddhist
temple as an act of grace. The same may be
said of Kuan Ti,<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> the God of War, Lung Wang<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a>
the Dragon Raja or Naga-king, and the San
Kuan.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></p>

<p>From this temple a short walk over a wooden-paved
path, kept clear of snow by sedulous sweeping,
leads to the Hsi Wa Tien<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a>&mdash;the Pewter-Roofed
Hall. At one time there were three "halls,"
with roofs of pewter, bronze and iron respectively.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
The metal roofs have vanished, though the names
remain. "Pewter-roof" is specially appropriate
to a Buddhist monastery, for pewter is the only
metal that Buddhist monks may&mdash;in theory&mdash;possess.
Each monk is supposed to carry a pewter-headed
staff when he goes on pilgrimage or on his
begging-rounds; and when he lodges at a monastery
he is said to <i lang="zh">kua hsi</i>, which literally means "to
hang up the pewter." In south China there is a
spring called the Pewter Spring, because it bubbled
up at the bidding of a thirsty monk who struck the
ground with his staff.</p>

<p>Another short climb brought me at last to the
summit of Mount Omei, where, at a height of
about 11,000 feet, I found welcome and rest in
the spacious monastery that proudly describes itself
as "The Golden Hall of the True Summit."<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></p>

<p>Though I was not expected by the monks&mdash;for
my two soldiers had failed to keep up with me
in spite of my efforts to send them on as my
ambassadors&mdash;I was at once made comfortable
in a large, clean apartment on the first floor;
and when my hosts heard that I was a humble
student of their religion they soon provided me
with as ample a vegetarian banquet as I could
have desired, and treated me with great kindness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"THE GLORY OF BUDDHA"</div>

<p>An hour after my arrival I stood outside the
temple gateway watching the sun set below<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
a wild white ocean of clouds that laved the
mountain side about 2,000 feet below me and
turned the summit of Mount Omei into a snow-draped
island. The air rapidly grew bitterly cold,
and I was glad to seek warmth indoors by the
side of my charcoal fire. My dilatory escort,
carrying my modest baggage, came wearily in just
as it began to grow dark.</p>

<p>The next morning held in store a wonderful
surprise. The vast ocean of white clouds had
entirely disappeared, and the wide country that lay
far below me was bathed in the glory of brilliant
sunlight. The sun rarely reveals himself in his
full splendour in Ssuch'uan&mdash;so rarely that when
he does so the dogs are said to bark at him<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a>&mdash;and
on Omei's summit sunshine is rare even for
Ssuch'uan; but by good fortune it was on one of
those exceptional occasions that I spent there the
whole of one memorable day.</p>

<p>There are several monasteries on or near
the summit. The one in which I lodged for
two nights is crowned with a gilded ball that
scintillates on its roof. Just behind the various
buildings of this monastery is the tremendous
precipice from the edge of which fortunate pilgrims
witness the phenomenon known as the "Glory of
Buddha."<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> As mentioned in the last chapter, this
is the appearance of a gleaming aureole floating
horizontally on the mist a few thousand feet below
the summit. This beautiful phenomenon, to which
is probably due the special sanctity of Mount Omei,
has not yet been quite satisfactorily explained. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
has been likened to the famous Brocken Spectre,
and to the Shadow of the Peak in Ceylon, but the
brilliant and varied colours of "Buddha's Glory"&mdash;five
colours, say the Chinese&mdash;give it a rainbow-like
beauty which those appearances do not possess.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a>
The pious Buddhist pilgrim firmly believes that it
is a miraculous manifestation of the power and
glory of the Buddha&mdash;or of his spiritual Son P'u
Hsien&mdash;and is always much disappointed if he has
to leave the mountain without catching a glimpse
of it.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> The necessary conditions of its appearance
are said to be a clear sky above and a bank of
clouds below, and as those conditions were not
fulfilled for me I must sorrowfully confess that I
cannot describe the spectacle from personal experience.
But the circumstance that deprived me of
that privilege enabled me to have a superb view
of the surrounding country. Nearly 10,000 feet
below me to the north and east lay the rich
rolling plains of central Ssuch'uan; to the south
the silver streak of the Ta Tu river and the wild
mountains that enable the mysterious Lolo races
to maintain their solitary independence; slightly
to the south-west appeared the huge mass of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
Wa mountain, with its extraordinary flat summit
and its precipitous flanks; and, grandest sight
of all, clear and brilliant on the western horizon
stood out the mighty barrier of towering peaks
appropriately known by the Chinese as the Ta
Hsüeh Shan&mdash;Great Snow Mountains. Those
are the peaks&mdash;some of them 20,000 feet high,
and more&mdash;that keep watch and ward over the
lofty Tibetan plateau on the one side and the
rolling plains of China on the other: the eastern
ramparts of the vast Himālayan range, whose
icy fingers seem ever to grope outward into the
silent abyss of space as if seeking to grasp the
fringe of a mightier world than ours. Even at a
distance of nearly 100 miles as the crow flies the
pinnacles seemed too lofty to be real; but it
was pleasant to know that a few weeks hence I
should be in the midst of the great mountains,
perhaps learning something of their hidden
mysteries.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE OMEI PRECIPICE</div>

<p>The narrow gallery behind the monastery
from which one watches for a manifestation of
Buddha's Glory is carefully railed, for a fall from
this spot would mean a sheer drop of more than a
mile down the face of a precipice which, as Baber
has remarked, is perhaps the highest in the world.
Many are the stories told by the monks of men
and women who in moments of wild religious
exaltation have hurled themselves down to win
death and paradise in one glorious instant by
throwing themselves into the bosom of their
Lord Buddha: true stories, which have well
earned for this terrible precipice the name of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
"The Rejection of the Body."<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> Less sinister
names which have been given it are the Diamond
Terrace and the Silvery Boundary,&mdash;the latter<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a>
perhaps because Mount Omei is regarded as the
eastern buttress of the Great Snow Mountains;
or perhaps the words refer to the view of those
mountains on the western horizon. Near the edge
of the cliff are the remains of a once famous bronze
temple, which was several times struck by lightning
and has never been restored since the date of the
last catastrophe. Some of the castings are exceedingly
fine and well worthy of preservation.
A Chinese proverb says that Heaven grants compensation
for what the lightning has destroyed,<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a>
but in this instance it seems to have failed of
fulfilment.</p>

<p>The temple at which I stayed harbours about
twenty monks and acolytes, and visitors both
lay and monastic are constantly coming and
going. I observed there the performance of an
interesting custom, whereby the monks who come
on pilgrimage from distant monasteries produce
papers of identification and have them stamped
with the seal of each of the monasteries they
visit. As their journeys are made that they may
"gain merit," not only for themselves but also
for the religious communities which they represent,
it is important that on their return they should
be able to produce duly authenticated certificates
that they have actually attained the objects of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
their pilgrimage. In many cases the establishment
visited also grants Buddhist tracts or plans
of its own buildings. One such crude plan&mdash;representing
the mountain of Omei with its
principal religious houses&mdash;is reproduced here on
a reduced scale. The monastic seal (in red in
the original) appears at the top. Some yellow-robed
monks from a large monastery near Pao-ning-fu
in north-eastern Ssuch'uan, and a small
group of lamas from Litang, on the Tibetan
border, were having their papers sealed at the
time of my arrival at the Golden Summit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BUDDHIST MATINS</div>

<p>During my day's rest I attended two religious
services, besides a "choir-practice" of young boys
who had not yet become fully-fledged monks.
The services were well intoned, and, considering
one's strange surroundings, had a singular impressiveness.
The ordinary daily prayers are very
simple, consisting in little more than repeated
invocations of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas: they
are "praises" rather than prayers. The ordinary
Morning Service or Matins (Tsao K'o)<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> begins
with a procession of monks into the principal hall
or chapel&mdash;<i lang="zh">Ta hsiung pao tien</i>,<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> "The Precious
Hall of the Great Lord (or Hero")&mdash;where, after
circling round the central figure of Sakyamuni,
keeping one bared shoulder towards the image,
they take their seats on low benches on left and
right. In front of Sakyamuni are lighted candles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
and burning sticks of incense. The service then
begins by the general invocation, <i lang="zh">Nam Mo Pên
Shih Shih Chia Mou-ni-Fo</i>:<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> "Praise to our Lord
Sakyamuni Buddha." This is followed by <i lang="zh">Nam
Mo Tan Lai Mi Lei Tsun Fo</i>:<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> "Praise to the
Honoured One Maitrêya, the Buddha that is to
be." The Buddhas of the past and future having
thus been honoured, a bell is sounded to announce
a change in the manner of address, when somewhat
similar phrases of adoration, interspersed with
short hymns of praise, are sung in honour of some
of the great Bodhisattvas, those selected at the
service attended by me being the following, in
the order named: <i lang="zh">Wên Shu Shih Li</i><a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> (Manjusri,

<div class="sidenote">BUDDHIST VESPERS</div>

<p>The most interesting part of the service consists
in the short "lections" of extracts from
the scriptures, which take the place of the lessons
and sermons of Christian churches. The lections
are followed by short hymns, some of which
have been specially composed for liturgical purposes
and are not to be found in the sacred
books. Several processions and prostrations take
place during the service. The intoning when

<p>The Evening Service or Vespers (Wan K'o<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a>)

<p>"Buddha's Glory" is not the only marvel that
the fortunate pilgrim may hope to behold when he
reaches the Golden Summit. Night, on Mount
Omei, has its treasures hardly less glorious than
those of day. These take the form of myriads of
little lights, moving and glimmering like winged
stars in the midst of an inverted firmament. They
are known as the Shêng Têng (Holy Lamps),<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> and
have been described to me&mdash;for alas! I saw them
not&mdash;as brilliant specks of light darting hither and
thither on the surface of the ocean of mist on
which in daytime floats the coloured aureole. A
fanciful monk suggested to me that they are the
scintillating fragments of the "Glory of Buddha,"
which is shattered at the approach of night and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
reformed at the rising of the sun. Foreigners have
supposed that they are caused by some electrical
disturbance; but the monk's explanation, if the
less scientific of the two, is certainly the more
picturesque.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DESCENT OF MOUNT OMEI</div>

<p>The monastery in which I was entertained is
probably the largest on the summit, but by far
the most famous is its neighbour, the Hsien Tsu
Tien,<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> which is believed to occupy the site of the
original temple to P'u Hsien that according to the
legend was built by P'u Kung in the Han dynasty
after he had tracked the lily-footed deer to the
edge of the great precipice and had beheld the
wonderful sight thenceforth known as the "Glory
of Buddha." The temple contains a large sedent
image of the patron saint, and behind it is a terrace
from which may be seen the manifold wonders
of the abyss. Not far from this building is the
Monastery of the Sleeping Clouds,<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> and further
off are the temples of the Thousand Buddhas
(Ch'ien Fo) and the White Dragon.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></p>

<p>I regretfully left the summit of Mount Omei
on my downward journey early on the morning
of 10th March, and, after many a slip and sprawl
on the snow, reached the Wan-nien monastery
in the afternoon. Here I spent a night for the
second time, and continued the descent on the
following morning. Just below the temple of the
Pai Lung (White Dragon) which I had already
visited, the road bifurcates; and as both branches
lead eventually to Omei-hsien, I naturally chose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
the one that was new to me. By this time I
had left far behind me the snow and icicles of
the higher levels, and had entered a region of
warm air and bright green vegetation. The change
was startling, as though by some magic power the
seasons had been interchanged.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div></div>

<p>Shelley's dream would have been realised on the
slopes of Mount Omei.</p>

<p>Between the bifurcation of the roads and the
foot of the mountain there are a number of monasteries,
few of which possess any feature calling
for special remark, except the romantic beauty
of their situations. The most conspicuous are
the Kuang Fu Ssŭ,<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> or "Monastery of Abounding
Happiness"; the Lung Shêng Kang,<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> or "Mountain
Ascending Dragon," from which there is a splendid
view of the Golden Summit; the Kuan Yin Ssŭ,<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a>
or "Monastery of Avalokiteçvara"; the Chung Fêng
Ssŭ,<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> "Half-Way Monastery"; and the Ta O
Ssŭ,<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> the "Monastery of Great O" (<i>i.e.</i> Omei Shan,
Mount Omei), which is a spacious building, often
visited by holiday-making Protestant missionaries
from Chia-ting. After passing this building the
downward path leads across a small bridge, called
the "Bridge of the Upright Heart" (Chêng Hsin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
Ch'iao<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a>), to the monastery named Hui Têng Ssŭ<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a>
("The Spiritual Lamp"), from the neighbourhood
of which the view of the mountain summit is of
exceptional beauty. A charming road leads thence
past several other monasteries, down to the level
plain, whence the walk to Omei-hsien is easy.
Before I reached the city the great mountain
had vanished from my sight and I never saw it
again: from peak to base it had disappeared into
impenetrable mist. There was only the soft sound
of a distant monastery bell to assure me that
somewhere in the clouds the sacred mountain
might still be looked for not in vain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEPARTURE FOR YA-CHOU-FU</div>

<p>I have dwelt long upon the Buddhistic associations
of Omei; and perhaps the reader is wearied
by an account of temples and of forms of belief
that he considers grotesque and uncouth. I
should be sorry if I were to leave him with the
impression that Omei possesses no interest beyond
the glimmer that is shed upon it by the Light of
Asia. If every monastery were to crumble into
dust, if the very memory of Buddhism were to
be swept utterly away from the minds of men,
Omei would still remain what it was before the
first Buddhist recluse had built there his lonely
hermitage&mdash;it would still be a home of portent and
mystery, the abode of nameless spirits of mountain
and flood, the source of inspiration to poet and
artist, the resort of pilgrims from many lands,
each of whom&mdash;whatever his faith&mdash;would find,
as he gazed from the edge of the Golden Summit
into the white abyss below, a manifestation of
the Glory of his own God.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

<p class="center">OMEI-HSIEN TO TACHIENLU</p>


<p>An easy journey of four days from Omei-hsien
brought me to the prefectural city of Ya-chou-fu.
During the first day the road lay through the
northern portion of the same well-cultivated plain
that stretches to the south-east as far as Chia-ting.
Large areas were devoted to the cultivation of
the small ash-tree which is used to assist in the
production of the insect-wax. The yellow blossom
of the rape was everywhere in bloom, and pervaded
the air with the most delicate of perfumes; while
the wheat-fields were just beginning to wear their
spring raiment of bright green. Towards evening
my road lay across the river Ya to the small
magisterial town of Chia-chiang, where I spent
the night. Next day, soon after starting, we
again crossed the Ya in a ferry-boat and thence
proceeded for a few miles along the right bank.
Near the ferry-crossing I noticed on the left bank
numerous shrines and small caves hollowed by
nature and by art out of the face of a cliff. Sticks
of incense were burning in front of several of
the miniature images contained in them. From
this point onward the road lay through a very
picturesque district studded with groves of fine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
trees and two or three good pagodas, and beautified
by the fresh blossom of peach and cherry and
by wild primroses that seemed to grow out of
the solid rock. In the afternoon we again crossed
to the left bank of the river in order to reach
the magisterial town of Hung Ya, the main street
of which we passed through. Another six miles
brought us to the poor village of Chih-kuo-chên.
The accommodation was very bad, as I
had passed beyond the ordinary stage. The whole
river-valley from Chia-chiang upwards is the resort
of great numbers of wild-duck, a few of which fell
to my gun, though the season was late, and they
were not at that time plentiful.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BASKET-BRIDGES</div>

<p>A curious feature
of the shallower waterways of this district is the
basket-bridge. Large wicker baskets are filled
with loose stones and deposited in the bed of the
river at even distances of about 10 feet. Planks
of that length are placed on the top of them
and constitute the bridge. This device has the
merit of cheapness, but as soon as the basket is
rotted by the action of the water, the stones
gradually subside, and the planks are submerged.
The Ya river, here as elsewhere, is too full of
rocks and rapids for navigation. Long timber
rafts, however, make the journey from Ya-chou to
Chia-ting at all seasons of the year, except in the
height of the rainy season, and serious accidents
are rare.</p>

<p>Next day the road led tortuously through the
river-valley and crossed the stream several times.
After one ferry-crossing I was faced by a stiff
climb of about 800 or 1,000 feet leading to a pass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
where there is a primitive tea-house. A corresponding
descent on the other side soon led us back
to the river's edge, at a point where the stream
is very turbulent. We crossed by a bridge called
the "Bridge of the Goddess of Mercy" (Kuan Yin
Ch'iao), formed of long slabs of stone, and immediately
afterwards passed through the village of the
same name. Another 4 or 5 miles brought me
to the small town of Ts'ao Pa, where I spent the
night. This town lies in a plain surrounded by
hills in every direction except the east and north-east.
It lies on the left bank of the river at a
point where the current is gentle and the bed very
broad and shallow.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a></p>

<p>On the morning of the following day, 14th
March, I reached Ya-chou-fu, the seat of government
of a taotai, whose jurisdiction extends to
the Tibetan border. The town is important as
being on the "mandarin" road from Peking to
Lhasa, and also as being the centre of a great
tea district.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> It is in the plains surrounding
Ya-chou that the inferior tea which is considered
good enough for the Tibetan market is grown,
and from here it is carried in long, narrow bundles
on the backs of coolies to Tachienlu. There it
is cut into cakes or bricks, packed in yak-hides,
and carried by Tibetans all the way to Lhasa,
and even to the borders of India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AMERICAN BAPTIST MISSION</div>

<p>At Ya-chou I was most hospitably entertained
by the members of the American Baptist Mission,
who, judging from the friendliness with which they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
were greeted in the streets, were evidently on
excellent terms with the people. The Mission
has established a dispensary and a school, and
at the time of my visit was engaged in the construction
of a large hospital. To make invidious
comparisons between different missionary bodies
in China is unbecoming for a traveller who has
been treated by all with every possible courtesy;
but if I venture to refer to the American Baptist
Mission with special praise, it is only because the
members of that Mission whom I have had the
good fortune to meet happen to have been persons
of broad sympathies and more than ordinary culture
and refinement.</p>

<p>The hospitalities of Ya-chou induced me to
break my journey here for one day, which I spent
in exploring the town and neighbourhood. It
is situated in a rather confined plateau nearly
surrounded by hills, including one mountain, the
Chou Kung Shan, which, as a place of pilgrimage,
is a humble rival of Omei.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> At Ya-chou I paid
off the somewhat uncouth "boy" whom I had
engaged at Ch'êng-tu, and found a successor to
accompany me to Tachienlu. I also engaged a
new set of coolies. A sedan-chair which I had
bought on leaving the Yangtse at Wan-hsien had
been with me the whole way, but I very seldom
used it, except when entering and leaving large
towns. At Ya-chou I might as well have left it
behind, and so reduced the number of my coolies
by half; for I did not enter it after the day I left
that city. I abandoned it finally at Tachienlu.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span></p>

<p>Almost immediately on leaving Ya-chou on
the next portion of my journey I entered into
the mountainous region that fringes the Tibetan
plateau. Marco Polo evidently passed through
the Ya-chou plain on his journey from Ch'êng-tu
to Yunnan-fu <i lang="la">viâ</i> the Chien-ch'ang valley. In
his day Ya-chou must have been a frontier town
on the extreme west of Cathay, for all the
mountainous region beyond belonged to Tibet.
Like most border regions this district was the
scene of constant warfare, and Messer Marco
draws a pitiful picture of its utter desolation. It
was infested, apparently, by wild beasts, as well
as by wild men. But since his day the political
boundary of China has been moved steadily
westwards, and the province of Ssuch'uan now
nominally includes a vast tract of country that
was once, and still to a great extent is, inhabited
by Tibetans or allied tribes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GREAT ELEPHANT PASS</div>

<p>On 16th March, a few miles' walk from Ya-chou
brought me to the Flying Dragon Pass (Fei
Lung Ling), about 3,600 feet high. Hosie,
describing this road, says that "a long pull over
a frightful road brought us to the summit";<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a>
but the weather must have been against him, for
I experienced no difficulty, and found the road
no worse than roads in China usually are.
About 65 <i lang="zh">li</i> (barely 20 miles) from Ya-chou
brought me to the village of Shih-chia Ch'iao,
where I spent the night in a rather good inn.
Next day I went up the right bank of a stream
that flows north-east to meet the Ya, and after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
twice crossing it reached the small district town
of Jung-Ching, in the streets of which I smashed
a carved Buddha-headed mountain-pole that I had
bought on Mount Omei, in my efforts to beat off
a dog that presented every appearance of insanity.
Late in the afternoon I reached the end of the
stage at Huang-ni-p'u, a small straggling village
on the slopes of the mountain range that was to
be crossed on the following day. The pass, which
is known as the Great Elephant (Ta Hsiang Ling)
is 9,200 feet high&mdash;less than 2,000 feet lower
than the summit of Mount Omei. Huang-ni-p'u
lies at a height of about 3,870 feet; so the actual
climb that faced us on the 18th March was about
5,330 feet. The pass, according to one interpretation,
derives its name from the elephant on which
P'u Hsien rode from India to Mount Omei; but
that legend, as we have seen, has no basis in fact.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a>
I started the ascent early in the morning, amid the
glorious weather that had smiled upon me ever
since I entered Ssuch'uan; and my dog Jim and I
climbed the pass amid slush and snow with a
rapidity which entirely baffled the efforts of the
two soldiers who formed my escort to keep up
with us. I reached the summit about midday, and
rested in one of the numerous refreshment shanties
that cater for the tea-coolies, of whom I passed
many hundreds during the journey from Ya-chou
to Tachienlu. The weights that these men carry
on their backs are enormous. A single man
carries as much as 300 and sometimes 400 pounds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
weight.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> They receive twenty or thirty cents a
day each, according to the weight carried, and
spend about three weeks on the journey. An
unburdened traveller traverses the same distance
in eight days. The coolies walk very slowly, as
a slip might have dangerous consequences. My
own greatest difficulty in making the ascent of
the Ta Hsiang Ling was to pass these people on
the narrow path, especially when a string of them
stood sideways to rest their burdens on their
wooden props: for they never unload themselves
on the road, owing to the great difficulty of
getting the burden on to their backs again. I
saw only one man meet with an accident. He
was passing under an overhanging ledge of rock,
and tried to dodge a long ice stalactite. This
unbalanced him, and he fell on the path with his
huge load uppermost. Till we had extricated
him I saw nothing but his legs; but he rose up
smiling, and some friendly hands assisted him in
replacing his burden.</p>

<p>The temperature at the summit was not lower
than 43° in the shade, according to my thermometer,
but that was at midday. The snow
was melting fast under a hot sun. The view from
the ridge was on both sides magnificent. There
was no mist, and the bright sunshine made the
distant peaks with their white caps stand out with
marvellous vividness against the deep-blue sky.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BORDER WARFARE</div>

<p>Having descended from the snowy heights of
the Great Elephant Pass, and so having left the
plains of China out of sight for many weeks to
come, I found myself in the little city of Ch'ing-ch'i-hsien,
which in spite of its diminutive size
and remoteness from Western influences is so far
advanced in civilisation as to possess a girls' school.
There is also a temple dedicated to Kuan-Ti (the
so-called "God of War"), which was an appropriate
circumstance, as soldiers and military supplies
were being duly hastened through the town in
connection with the border warfare that was being
carried on between the Chinese and Tibetans south
of Batang. I noticed a versified proclamation in
the streets warning the people not to be alarmed
at the sight of the soldiers, and promising that all
supplies required for their use would be paid for at
current market rates. I passed several small bodies
of troops between Ya-chou and Tachienlu, and as
far as I could observe they were very well-behaved.
There were no foreign-drilled troops among them,
and they carried the old-fashioned firearms that
China is now rapidly learning to discard. What
was perhaps a more noteworthy circumstance was
the fact that the troops were being regularly paid,
and that the commissariat arrangements worked
without a hitch. I heard few details of what was
actually taking place at the front until I reached
Tachienlu, but it was evident that the provincial
authorities were dealing with the trouble in a
thoroughly energetic manner. The difficulties of
sending military supplies and munitions of war
from Ch'êng-tu to the borders of Tibet must have
been enormous. Ta Hsiang Ling was only one
of a number of great passes that had to be crossed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
before the scene of warfare could be reached. The
dragging of field artillery over a succession of wild
mountains where the highest of the passes rises to
more than 15,000 feet, is a feat which can perhaps
be best appreciated by those who helped to perform
a similar one during the British march to Lhasa.</p>

<p>Ch'ing-ch'i-hsien was at one time a city of great
strategic importance, and was the scene of many
a fierce struggle between the Chinese and the
Lolos&mdash;who have now retired many miles to the
south. At other times, too, the Chinese have
been hard put to it to defend themselves against
the quasi-Tibetan tribes and Mantzŭ who still
inhabit the mountains to the west. Its natural
position, at the edge of a ravine or natural moat,
is a very strong one, and a besieging force armed
with primitive weapons would have very little
chance of taking it by storm unless they first
secured the Great Elephant Pass: for on that
side only the city has no natural protection except
the mountain range itself.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a></p>

<p>Immediately on leaving Ch'ing-ch'i by the
west gate we descended into the ravine which
protects it on the west and south, and crossed
the sparkling mountain stream from which the
city derives its name. The road then gradually
ascends along the flank of some bare hills,
picturesque but with little cultivation. It then
descends and passes between high hills, issuing
thence into a broad valley in which flows the
stream Liu Sha ("Shifting Sands"). On its left
bank is the village of Fu Chuang.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> A little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
further on the valley gradually contracts, leaving
only an insignificant area for cultivation. What
there is of it is said to be very rich, chiefly owing
to the periodical inundations, which render it
suitable for rice. The hills are mostly bare, and
trees are few except in the neighbourhood of
houses. The next place of any importance is
known as Ni (or I) T'ou Courier Stage, which
is a large village of comparative importance, and
contains excellent inns. Here we spent the night
to recuperate our energies in anticipation of the
pass that lies just beyond.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FEI YÜEH LING</div>

<p>Ni T'ou lies about 4,900 feet above the sea-level,
and the summit of the Fei Yüeh Ling is
9,000 feet high, only slightly less than the Great
Elephant. For a considerable part of the way
the path led up the valley of the Liu Sha, which
rises in the mountains on the east side of the
pass. Above Ni T'ou it is simply a turbulent
mountain stream rushing downwards through a
picturesque gorge.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> The final climb of 1,500 feet
is very steep, but the dangers and difficulties of the
pass have been much exaggerated not only by the
Chinese chroniclers&mdash;who, like all the <i lang="la">literati</i> of
their country, are sure to have been bad pedestrians&mdash;but
also by at least one European. The <i lang="zh">Hsi
Tsang T'u K'ao</i> quite unnecessarily describes it as
"the most dangerous place in China."<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> The view
from the top&mdash;which is a narrow ridge&mdash;is less
grand than that from the Ta Hsiang Ling, owing
to the proximity of other lofty ranges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span></p>

<p>One of the poets of the present dynasty (Hsü
Chang) has declared in a pleasant poem that the
ascent of this mountain is like the soaring of a
swan, the descent like the swooping of a hawk.
This is a picturesque description, but it could
hardly be applied with appositeness to a certain
Buddhist monk who was met on the pass some
years ago by a Western traveller.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> The monk
was doing a pilgrimage from P'u T'o (Chusan) to
Lhasa, and had already been seven years on the
road. His somewhat slow progress was accounted
for by the fact that at every two steps of his
journey he prostrated himself at full length on
the ground. He was quite cheerful, and anticipated
that in two or three years more he would
reach Lhasa. Without assuming that there was
anything either swanlike or hawklike in my movements
I may claim to have crossed the Fei Yüeh
Ling rather more rapidly than the monk, and I
reached the end of the day's stage&mdash;the village of
Hua-lin-p'ing&mdash;early in the afternoon.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> Shortly
before arriving there I turned off the road to visit
a picturesque temple which I espied embowered
in a grove of trees on the right bank of a mountain
torrent. It is dedicated to Kuan Yin, but
the Guardian Deity of the Kao Shan ("Lofty
Mountain") also has a shrine in the temple
grounds. Behind the main hall, which contains
the eighteen lo-han in miniature, and a cast-iron
bell dated the second year of Tao Kuang (1822),
there is a timber-built monastery in which a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
monks reside. Higher up is a pavilion which
contains among other things a black wooden
tablet recording the names of those who had
subscribed towards the restoration of the building
after its destruction by wind and rain. The
grounds of the temple are well laid out, and
there is a fine view.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MOUNTAIN SCENERY</div>

<p>Hua-lin-p'ing is a village of two streets,
one of them broader and cleaner than is usual
in Chinese villages. Most of the inhabitants, however,
are not pure Chinese. A proclamation on
the walls stated that a large number of coolies
were being employed by Government on transport
service, in connection with the border war, and
that if any such coolie used any military supplies
for his own purposes or sold them to civilians
he would be punished with relentless severity;
and that a like fate would befall any civilian
who bought such goods from him.</p>

<p>There is great abundance of coal in the hills
about Hua-lin-p'ing, and it is freely used by
the poorest peasants for heating and cooking
purposes. Judging from the coal which was
brought to me in a brazier it appeared to be of
excellent quality, for it burned well, and gave
out considerable heat with hardly any smoke.
The temperature in these mountain villages was
generally low enough to make artificial warmth
very desirable; but the fumes of charcoal are
not conducive to cheerfulness or to health, and
coal was a welcome surprise.</p>

<p>For the remaining three days of my journey
to Tachienlu the scenery was of great beauty
and grandeur. I have seldom seen anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
more magnificent than the view of mighty
mountains that greeted me as I left Hua-lin-p'ing,
and continued to face me nearly all the
rest of the way. The lustre of the snow, the
rich azure of the sky and the sombre shadows
of the gorges and ravines combined to make a
series of pictures which no words can describe,
and which time can never efface from the memory.
There are scenes which an artist could never
be weary of painting, a poet never weary of
describing: yet both would assuredly fail to
communicate the secret of their loveliness to
those who had never seen. There are times,
of course, when the glories of the scenery are
hidden by clouds or dimmed by rain and mist,
and many a traveller must have gone through
this country with very little idea of the wonderful
sights that were hidden from him; but the
good fortune that accompanied me to the summit
of Mount Omei did not forsake me for even
half a day during my long walk to Tachienlu,
for the sun was never eclipsed by a cloud, and
the lustrous peaks that towered skyward never
once robed themselves in fog.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LU TING BRIDGE</div>

<p>From Hua-lin-p'ing the road descends
steeply till it reaches the beautiful valley of the
Ta Tu. This great river I had not seen since
I left Chia-ting, where it joins the Min. Like
the Ya river, its current is too swift and the
rapids are too dangerous to admit of navigation.
Between Lu Ting Ch'iao (which I reached the
same day) and the junction with the Min the
fall of the river is no less than 3,750 feet.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
The road to Lu Ting keeps to the left bank of
the river, sometimes at a height above it of
several hundred feet, and sometimes (as at the
village of Lêng Chi) close to the river bank.
Lu Ting, which gives its name to an important
suspension bridge, is about 20 miles from
Hua-lin-p'ing. Shortly before reaching it I
passed safely over a somewhat dangerous section
of the road, where from a steep bank rocks and
stones frequently crash down over the path and
into the river, with disastrous results to unwary
passengers. Hosie describes how a large stone
the size of his head narrowly missed striking
him, and how he saw the body of a man who
had been struck dead, his weeping wife and friends
trying to remove the corpse without endangering
their own lives. The vicinity of Lu Ting
must be beautiful at all seasons, but it was
particularly so at the time of my arrival there,
on account of the wonderful display of myriads
of fruit-tree blossoms. Had I come at a later
season I should no doubt have been able to
endorse Rockhill's verdict as to the excellence
of the peaches.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> The town itself is small and
dirty, but its position renders it of some commercial
importance, for through it all the trade
that follows this main route between China and
Tibet must pass. The iron suspension bridge
towards which all the streets of the town converge
affords the only means of crossing the Ta
Tu. This fine bridge, which has been several
times repaired since its construction more than
two hundred years ago, is about 120 yards long.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
It may now be regarded as the iron chain that
connects China and Chinese Tibet.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> Geographically
and ethnologically the Ta Tu river is the eastern
boundary of Tibet, for, though the steady advance
of Chinese influence has caused the political
boundary to be moved further and further west,
the races that inhabit the western side of the
Ta Tu are still predominantly Tibetan, Mantzŭ,
or Hsi Fan,<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> and the tribal chiefs are still left in
complete control of their mountainous territories.
The Chinese have indeed driven a wedge into
this region as far as Tachienlu in order to maintain
control over the high-road to Lhasa; but they
interfere very little with the government of the
country. Beyond the Ta Tu the country is not
divided into magisterial districts, and the jurisdiction
of the Ch'ing-ch'i magistrate extends
only as far as Lu Ting. Recent maps of China
make the province of Ssuch'uan extend further
west even than Batang, but the whole of the
region I have referred to should properly be
marked on the maps as Chinese Tibet,<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> or as
Tibetan Ssuch'uan. There is, of course, an extraordinary
mixture of races and languages in this
wild border region, but the prevailing type is
anything but Chinese; and in religion, history
and social customs the people who inhabit this
territory obviously belong to one of the numerous
allied races of which Tibet is composed to-day.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">TIBETAN PILGRIMS</div>

<p>After crossing the bridge the road leads along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
the right bank of the Ta Tu for a distance of
nearly 20 miles. Villages are few and the population
is scanty. In the hamlet of Ta P'êng Pa
I rested in an eating-house kept by a Chinese,
who, to my surprise, greeted me in Pekingese.
As I sipped my tea he cheerfully informed me
that he had been a Boxer, and had left Peking
immediately after the allies had entered it. I
fancy he must have done so under a cloud; but
I did not press the subject, and amiably accepted
his assurance that, in spite of troublesome political
estrangements, he was sentimentally attached to
all foreigners. After Ta P'eng Pa there is a long
upward climb, followed by a short and sudden
descent to a wooden bridge crossing a mountain
stream. From here there is a magnificent view
of the snowy mountains in the south-west.</p>

<p>As this road is frequently tramped by Tibetan
pilgrims on their way to Mount Omei, I was not
surprised to find a number of wayside shrines.
If the name of Thomas Atkins is&mdash;I hope it is not-scribbled
over the walls of the Lhasa cathedral,
it is satisfactory to know that Tibetan feelings
cannot have been outraged thereby; for no more
inveterate wall-scribbler exists than your Tibetan
pilgrim. I found abundant evidence of this in the
shrines just referred to, as well as in the temples
of Chia-ting and Mount Omei.</p>

<p>Twenty-five <i lang="zh">li</i> beyond Ta-P'êng Pa the road
suddenly branches off to the left, leaving the
valley of the Ta Tu, and entering that of its tributary
the Lu, or, as the Tibetans call it, the Do
river. A steep descent soon led us to our resting-place,
the village of Wa Ssŭ Kou ("The Ravine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
of the Tile-roofed Monastery"). It consists of
one street, behind which are a few small maize-fields,
orchards and walnut trees in the level
ground between the village and the water's edge.
A small temple, presumably that from which the
village is named, overlooks a rather cranky iron
suspension bridge. This bridge crosses the Lu
to a steep path which climbs along the opposite
mountain side in the direction of the valley of
the Ta Tu, or Chin Ch'uan ("Gold Stream")<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a>&mdash;as
the Ta Tu is called above the junction with
the Lu. The path leads into the territory of
a tribal chief, subordinate to the Tibetan prince
who rules at Tachienlu. Hosie states that respectable
Chinese settling there are allowed to take
unto themselves temporary native wives, on payment
to the chief of three taels (less than half a
sovereign) per wife. "They are free," he adds,
"to leave the country when they choose, but
the wives and children must remain."<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> I spent
an afternoon exploring the fringe of this region,
the northern part of which was in the eighteenth
century the scene of a long and terrible struggle
between the imperial troops and the Chin Ch'uan
chiefs. Near the summit of the steep path that
creeps along the precipitous face of the cliff
opposite Wa Ssu Kou, there is a small shrine
dedicated to Kuan Yin, who is here regarded as
the protectress of a road which, without her protection,
might subside into the turbulent river
hundreds of feet below.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARRIVAL AT TACHIENLU</div>

<p>The next day I walked the remaining distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
&mdash;about 15 miles&mdash;to Tachienlu.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> The road keeps
to the right bank of the river the whole way, and
gradually ascends from 5,300 feet at Wa Ssŭ Kou
to 8,400 feet at Tachienlu. This is sufficient to
indicate that the Lu river is a wild torrent with
many waterfalls. In summer, after the melting
of the snows, it must present the appearance of
a continuous white cascade; even in spring its
waters are turbulent enough. I reached Tachienlu
early in the afternoon about five hours in advance
of my sluggish followers, and found a warm
welcome in the hospitable house of Mr and Mrs
Moyes, well known by name to those who have
studied the interesting history of missionary enterprise
among the Tibetans.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a></p>

<p>Tachienlu is a long, narrow little city which
has had to adapt its shape to that of the mountains
by which it is hemmed in. The summits of these
mountains are covered with snow all the year
round, and some are very lofty. According to
Bretschneider's map, one of them is estimated
at 25,592 feet, and another at 24,900 feet. Outside
the walls of the city there is hardly a foot
of level ground, except along the banks of the
river, which, on entering the city, cuts it into two
parts. It is the great emporium of trade between
China and Tibet, being the point at which Tibetans
and Chinese come from west and east, respectively,
to exchange the produce of the two countries.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
The contribution of China to this trade is chiefly
tea, with limited quantities of tobacco and cotton;
that of Tibet mainly consists of musk, gold-dust,
skins and various mysterious concoctions used
for medicines. The population of the town is
predominantly Tibetan, there being about seven
hundred Tibetan families to about four hundred
Chinese.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> In addition to the Tibetan families,
however, must be reckoned a great number of
lamas, most of whom live in large lamaseries
outside the city walls. Many of the houses&mdash;especially
the large inns&mdash;are of the well-known
two-storied Tibetan type, and on their flat roofs
flutter innumerable prayer-flags giving to the winds
the universal Tibetan hymn of praise, <i lang="bo">Om mane
padme hom</i>. The streets are generally noisy with
the sounds that always accompany buying and
selling in Eastern countries; but rarely so noisy
as to stifle the pious murmurings of red-frocked
lamas. For Tachienlu, like all Tibet, is priest-ridden.
Even the Chinese seem to succumb, after
a few years of residence there, to the wiles of priest-craft,
and constantly seek the assistance of lamas
in exorcising demons and invoking the protection
of the saints of lamaism. Many of the lamas
make a good deal of money by securing temporary
engagements as domestic chaplains; and the deep,
sonorous voices (assiduously cultivated from youth
upwards) in which they intone their dirge-like
spells and unintelligible prayers, penetrate far
beyond the walls of their improvised chapels.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

<p class="center">TACHIENLU</p>


<p>I remained in Tachienlu, where I found excellent
quarters in a Tibetan inn, from 23rd March to
15th April. During this period of more than
three weeks I exchanged visits with the Chinese
prefect and the Tibetan chief or "king" of
Chala, and made excursions to various places
of interest in the vicinity. My main object in
staying so long in one place was that I might
devote some attention to the Tibetan language,
of which I had previously acquired a very rudimentary
knowledge. With this end in view I
engaged a native teacher, a pleasant and mild-mannered
old gentleman, who, in the approved
Tibetan fashion, put out his tongue at me most
respectfully whenever I chanced to pronounce or
spell a word correctly. He officiated at the
king's court as a kind of soothsayer. I hoped
that my acquaintance with him might lead me
to endorse the opinion of Marco Polo, that
among the Tibetans are to be found "the best
enchanters and astrologers that exist in all that
quarter of the world." They, he goes on to
remark, "perform such extraordinary marvels and
sorceries by diabolic art that it astounds one to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
see or even hear of them."<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> Ser Marco was
more fortunate than I was, for no blandishments
on my part could wring any necromantic secrets
from my soothsayer. But perhaps he had none
to impart.</p>

<p>The climate of Tachienlu, as might be
expected at an altitude of over 8,000 feet, is
very bracing. The temperature sometimes sank
to the freezing point, and snow often fell during
the night, but the days were almost uniformly
bright and sunny. There was a slight shock
of earthquake on 30th March, and I was told
that the occurrence was a common one; certainly
it caused no consternation. The people of
Tachienlu are generally healthy and vigorous,
but the annual recurrence of typhus fever is a
great scourge. The poorer class of Tibetan
house is exceedingly dirty, and it can only be
the fine climate that prevents Tachienlu from
being frequently devastated by terrible epidemics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LHASA AMBAN</div>

<p>I have already observed that west of the river
Ta Tu the country is ruled by tribal chiefs, and
is not under the direct rule of China. The
chiefs are never interfered with so long as they
abstain from political intrigues, and are punctual
in the payment of their small tribute to the
Chinese Government. The Chinese, however,
fully recognise the importance of controlling the
main road into Tibet proper; they have, therefore,
stationed an officer of prefectural rank (<i lang="zh">chün
liang fu</i>) at Tachienlu, and his duty it is to
protect Chinese interests, and keep a watch over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
the movements of the Tibetan chiefs and kings.
He exercises jurisdiction over the Chinese of the
district&mdash;there are very few outside the town
itself&mdash;but has no judicial or administrative
control over the rest of the population. His
official duties are chiefly connected with transport
and commissariat arrangements, and in keeping
up regular communications between the governor-general
in Ch'êng-tu and the amban<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> or <i lang="zh">ch'in
ch'ai</i> at Lhasa. At the time of my visit his
hands were full owing to the frontier war, and
he was also burdened with the responsibility of
looking after the new amban, who arrived in
Tachienlu shortly before me on his way to Lhasa,
and was still there when I left three weeks later.
His predecessor, it may be remembered, was
brutally murdered at the instigation of the
lamas on the Tibetan frontier; and it was freely
admitted by the new amban's numerous retinue
that his courage, which had steadily diminished as
he proceeded westwards, had vanished altogether
when he reached Tachienlu. When it appeared
that the frontier war showed no signs of coming
to an end he applied, I understand, for leave to
proceed to Lhasa by way of India; but this
request was promptly refused by his superiors
at Peking. Some yak-loads of his baggage
started for the west shortly before I left the
city, and I presume he had made up his mind
to make a start soon afterwards. The turbulent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
condition of the tributary states which had
culminated in the murder of some French
missionaries and the assassination of the amban
seems to have forced the Chinese Government to
give its serious attention to the problems of the
frontier. As usually happens in China, the policy
determined on was one of ruthless severity. Two
large lamaseries were destroyed by the Chinese
troops, several of the leading lamas were put to
death, and the rest driven westward at the point of
the sword. Two tributary Tibetan chiefs, of rank
nearly equal to that of the king of Tachienlu, were
found guilty of treasonable intrigues, and promptly
executed. All these persons, if the stories told
of them were true, seem to have deserved their
fate. The events had occurred some time before
my arrival in Tachienlu, but as the war was
still in progress, and the lamas of the extreme
west were known to be the implacable enemies
of China, future possibilities still agitated the
minds of Chinese and Tibetans alike.</p>

<div class="sidenote">POLITICS IN TACHIENLU</div>

<p>The loyalty
of the chief or king of Chala was probably
above question, and he was quite powerful enough
to control any restlessness that might show itself
among the lamas of his own principality; but
there was some reason to believe that pressure
was being brought to bear on the Chinese Government
from an unknown source to induce it to
abolish all the territorial chieftainships, and parcel
out the whole country into regular magistracies
under Chinese officials right up to the nominal
frontier of Tibet proper. It was rumoured that
Tibet itself was to be turned into a Chinese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
province, and furnished with the usual hierarchy
of Chinese officials&mdash;the main object probably
being to frustrate the supposed designs of England
on that country&mdash;and that Ssuch'uan was to be
divided into two separate provinces. In view of
all these possibilities, it is clear that the position
of the tributary princes of Ssuch'uan was, and
probably still is, a somewhat precarious one;
and that the king of Chala, who could at any
moment be placed under lock and key by the
prefect at Tachienlu, would probably be the first
to suffer from the change of policy. It would
not be difficult for an unscrupulous Chinese official
to trump up vague charges of treason which might
quickly lead to the king's overthrow. Among
other rumours I heard that the Ya-chou taotai
was expected to move his headquarters temporarily
or permanently to Tachienlu, and that the king's
palace had already been selected as a suitable
residence for him. The king had not apparently
been consulted in this little matter. How the
local politics of Chala have developed since I left
that distracted kingdom I have had no opportunity
of learning; but if in another five years
the king is still swaying the fortunes of his little
monarchy he will deserve a good deal of credit
for his skilful manipulation of affairs during a
very trying period.</p>

<p>The territory of this potentate, including that
of the small chiefs subordinate to him, extends
from the Ta Tu river on the east to the Yalung
on the west, and for about seventeen days' journey
from north to south. The name of his princi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>pality
is spelt in Tibetan <i lang="bo">Lchags-la</i>, but, as usual
in Tibetan words, it is not pronounced as it is
written. Lchlags (pronounced <i lang="bo">cha</i>) is the Tibetan
for "iron," and <i lang="bo">la</i> means a mountain-pass. The
Chinese transliteration<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> of the word would in the
Pekingese dialect read Chia-na: but in western
Mandarin the <i>i</i> is elided, and the <i>n</i> is sounded
like an <i>l.</i> The king's own name in Chinese is
Chia I Chai.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> His Tibetan title, <i lang="bo">gyal-po</i>, which
means "king" or "ruling prince," sufficiently well
expresses the nature of the authority which he
exercises.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> Rockhill describes him as "one of the
most powerful chiefs of eastern Tibet, for among
them he alone demands and obtains obedience
from the lamas dwelling in his principality."<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a>
He rules by hereditary right, and has absolute
power over the lives and fortunes of his subjects.
The Chinese in his territory are exempt from
his jurisdiction, but they are so few in number,
except in the city itself, that the exemption counts
for little.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ULA</div>

<p>Beyond the periodical payment of a
small tribute, the only concession which he is
obliged to make to the suzerain power is the
privilege of <i>ula</i>. This word is neither Chinese
nor Tibetan, but is in universal use in Mongolia
and Tibetan countries.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> <i>Ula</i> is a system whereby
all Tibetans living in the neighbourhood or within
a certain distance of a caravan route are com<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>pelled
to furnish Government officials (Chinese
and Tibetan) with men, baggage-animals, and
food, either free of all cost or for a very small
fixed sum. The system has given rise to great
abuses, and has in some places caused so much
distress among the people that whole villages
have been abandoned and rich valleys left uncultivated.
The subjects of the king of Chala
were groaning under the weight of the <i>ula</i> system
at the time of my visit, and I heard the king
himself lamenting the sufferings which&mdash;owing
to the greed and harshness of Chinese military
officials&mdash;it caused his people. The burden at
that time was more than usually heavy, for the
Chinese Government insisted on exacting its full
rights of <i>ula</i> in connection with the carriage of
military supplies to the scene of warfare.</p>

<p>The only three official buildings of any
importance in Tachienlu are the residences or
yamêns of the king, the prefect or <i lang="zh">chün liang fu</i>
and a Chinese colonel (<i lang="zh">hsieh-t'ai</i>). Of these by
far the largest is the king's. I visited him a
day or two after my arrival, and was received
very cordially. He is a man of about forty
years of age, of rather delicate appearance, but
active and vivacious. He speaks Chinese (with
a strong Ssuch'uan accent) in addition to his
own language, and has adopted Chinese dress.
His position in Tachienlu cannot be a very
pleasant one, owing to the peculiar nature of his
relations with the Chinese Government. The
prefect appears to regard him as a kind of
enlightened savage, and apparently considers that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
the most effective method of demonstrating the
superiority of the suzerain power is to treat the
vassal with the least respect possible. The
Chinese regard all Tibetans much as they used
to regard Europeans&mdash;as barbarians outside the
pale of true civilisation. I heard it stated
that if a Chinese in Tachienlu kills a Tibetan he
is merely mulcted in two packets of tea, but
that if a Tibetan kills a Chinese the lives of
three Tibetans must pay the forfeit; I cannot,
however, vouch for the truth of this. The king
would be glad to remove the centre of his
government to another part of his territories and
leave Tachienlu to the absolute control of China;
but this he is not allowed to do. A few years
ago a lama versed in magic spells prophesied to
the king that if he spent any one of the next three
consecutive New Year seasons in Tachienlu great
misfortunes would fall upon him, but that if he
spent them elsewhere all would be well. The
king, who like all Tibetans is prone to superstition,
lent a willing ear to the wisdom of the
lama, and spent the last and first months of the
next two years in one of his mountain retreats.
When the third New Year season came round
the frontier war had commenced, and the king's
presence was urgently necessary in Tachienlu
in connection with the transport arrangements;
but his superstitious dread of unknown calamities
again decided him to retire to the mountains.
He came back in due course to find that he was
in trouble.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"SWORN BROTHERS"</div>

<p>The <i>ula</i> arrangements had suffered
by his absence, and the Chinese officials held<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
him to blame. Since then he has been zealously
endeavouring to regain the confidence of his
Chinese masters, with only partial success. His
friendly intercourse with the few Europeans he
has met is regarded somewhat suspiciously by
the Chinese as well as by the lamas; and it is
possible that when the days of trial and tribulation
come to him he will look&mdash;I fear he will look
in vain&mdash;to his European friends for protection
and support. With two or three of his Protestant
missionary friends he has actually entered into
"sworn brotherhood,"<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> an old Chinese custom
whereby close friends enter into a mutual compact
which creates between them a kind of fictitious
relationship. This may explain a not quite accurate
passage which occurs in Waddell's recent
book, <cite>Lhasa and its Mysteries</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> He says that
"the Tibetan chief of Dartsendo (Tachienlu), the
king of 'Chala,' is especially well-disposed towards
foreigners; and when the Dalai Lama threatened
to punish him on this account, he is reported to
have become 'sworn brothers' with the Protestant
Christian <i>Tibetans</i>." Colonel Waddell adds that
the king of Chala was said to be building forts in
his country, and could put ten thousand fighting
men in the field; but I know no reason for supposing
that the king's intentions are other than
entirely pacific.</p>

<p>A few weeks' residence in Tachienlu served
to open my eyes to the fact that scandal and gossip
are not confined to Western societies. Even the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
Tibetan is sufficiently civilised to take an intelligent
interest in his neighbour's sins. One story
which caused much hilarity among the Smart
Set of Tachienlu concerned the wife of a certain
court official. A distinguished person of royal
lineage (not the king) is a man who is known
to be of an amorous disposition, and has been
the hero of several pathetic romances. He gazed
upon the court official's lady and saw that she
was fair. Steps were immediately taken to send
the husband on a mission to a far country, he
having been assured that his domestic interests
would be carefully protected in his absence. The
lady, reluctantly or otherwise, speedily bestowed
her caresses on her exalted lover. For some
time all went well; but, unlike the less fortunate
Uriah in the Biblical story, the official returned to
his family in safety, discovered the intrigue, and
promptly repudiated his lady. The tragedy of the
situation consists in the fact that she was also
repudiated by her "royal" lover, his fickle affections
having meanwhile found another object.
The lady subsequently consoled herself by marrying
a Chinese merchant, and is said to be still
carrying on a monotonous existence within the
curtained recesses of that gentleman's private
house. The episode is one which might perhaps
be commended to Mr Stephen Phillips for dramatic
treatment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TACHIENLU GOSSIP</div>

<p>Court intrigues have given rise to incidents
more sombre than this. The last king, elder
brother of the present one, is said to have had
the date of his death foretold to him by a certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
lama. When the date was close at hand, the
king took ill and died, after two days' illness,
exactly on the date prophesied. For some dark
reason the lama&mdash;who should probably have been
tried for murder&mdash;succeeded in acquiring such
potent influence over the dead man's successor,
the present king, that he persuaded his Majesty
to adopt his daughter. Quite apart from the fact
that lamas have no right to possess daughters at
all, it does not seem to be quite clear what the
lama stood to gain by this proceeding. The king
was at that time childless, but he has since acquired
a daughter of his own. I saw both the lama's
child and the king's during a visit to the Summer
Palace in the mountains, and was astonished to
find that the lama's daughter&mdash;a little girl of eight&mdash;was
being brought up as a boy, and was attired
in boy's clothes. There was some mystery connected
with the whole affair which I failed to
fathom. As may be gathered from stories of
this kind, the lamas do not enjoy a good reputation.
Their private morals are not above reproach,
and they are too fond of meddling in mundane
affairs; but they do not wield the great political
power of which in other Tibetan states the lamas
have gradually possessed themselves.</p>

<p>The heir to the "kingdom" is the king's
younger brother, a very amiable man whose love
of outdoor sports would endear him to the heart
of many an Englishman. He does not meddle
with questions of <i lang="fr">la haute politique</i>, and loves to
spend his time in the delightful mountain residence
to which I have just referred as the Summer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
Palace, a place known in Chinese as the Yü Lin
Kung. I was invited to spend a few days there
as the king's guest, and was received and most
hospitably entertained by his brother. It is a
large, rambling building, beautifully situated in a
lonely spot among the mountains about 8 miles
from Tachienlu. One of the greatest attractions
of this place is a hot sulphur spring, the water
from which is made to flow into a capacious tiled
bath. The Tibetans are said to be an unclean
race&mdash;and I will not gainsay it&mdash;but they delight
in hot water when they can get it. The neighbouring
forests are strictly preserved for sporting
purposes, and afford splendid cover for pheasants
and other game. Our "bag" was an insignificant
one; but I was filled with admiration for the
zeal of the king's brother, who was armed only
with an old-fashioned muzzle-loading weapon of
venerable appearance and doubtful efficiency.
He deserved success, if he failed to command it.
Behind the palace are some of the tombs of the
royal family. They are surrounded by clusters of
prayer-flags&mdash;strips of white cloth tied to the top
of sticks or slender poles and bearing the usual
prayer formulas. Close by is a rivulet in which
there is a large prayer-wheel: a large wooden
cylinder, appropriately inscribed, placed perpendicularly
in a strong framework of timber. Through
the cylinder runs a fixed wooden pin, and the whole
structure is so arranged that the lower end of
the cylinder is always in the water. The flow
of the stream causes it to revolve unceasingly, and
each revolution is supposed to be equivalent to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
a single utterance of the words, <i lang="bo">om mane padme
hom</i>. The prayer-flags and prayer-wheels may
thus be regarded as continually engaged in saying
masses for the souls of the dead princes. In my
subsequent travels through the Tibetan states I
found wheels and flags of the same kind in great
abundance; and they are, of course, well known to
all who have travelled anywhere in Tibet. As a
rule, a cluster of flags is all that marks a Tibetan
graveyard, especially in places where cremation
is the general method of disposing of the dead.
Prayer-wheels may be found wherever there is
flowing water; and I observed that the Tibetans&mdash;who
have not as much objection as the Chinese
to imbibing cold water&mdash;would often stop to drink
just below a prayer-wheel, as if under the impression
that the water, which had performed
the pious act of turning the wheel, had acquired
thereby some mysterious sanctity. In connection
with this I may mention that holy water is
not a monopoly of Roman Catholic countries,
for it is quite commonly used for ritualistic purposes
in lama temples. As every reader knows,
this is not the only respect in which there are
resemblances or coincidences&mdash;sometimes startling
enough&mdash;between the ceremonial usages of lamaism
and Catholicism.</p>

<div class="caption">VIEW FROM THE "SUMMER PALACE" NEAR TACHIENLU.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">PRAYER-WHEELS</div>

<p>Prayer-wheels<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> may be turned either by water
or by hand. The ordinary small hand-wheel is
constantly seen in the hands of both lamas and
laymen. Old men, especially, who are anxious to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
devote their slender remnant of life in acquiring
new merit or destroying bad karma, hardly ever
go out of doors without their wheels. They twirl
them with their fingers as they walk, and years
of practice enable them to do it without any
conscious effort: indeed, I fancy that many old
men would twirl an imaginary wheel if the reality
were taken from them. It is curious to note
that the older a wheel is&mdash;that is, the more it
has been twirled&mdash;the more valuable it becomes;
for few Tibetans will exchange an old wheel for
a new one, and only the direst poverty will
induce them to sell this most precious of all
their possessions to a curio-hunter. Another
form of hand-wheel is similar in size and appearance
to a water-wheel. It is inserted perpendicularly
in specially-constructed recesses, and may
be twirled round its pin by any devout passer-by.
Sometimes it is found in the wall of a temple,
and not infrequently in a private house. In the
latter case it is generally found inside the house
on the right-hand side of the main doorway as
one enters. Every one who goes in or out gives
it a revolution or two. The stranger on entering
thus confers a kind of benediction on his
host, and at the same time accumulates a little
merit for himself. The custom is an amiable one,
and certainly does no one any harm. Not content
with flags and prayer-wheels, the Tibetans are
also very fond of erecting piles of stones on
which are loosely-placed innumerable flat slabs,
of varying shapes and sizes, each bearing the
<i lang="bo">om mane</i> formula in large, carved letters. These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
are variously termed <i lang="bo">obo</i>,<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> <i lang="bo">mani-drombo</i> and <i lang="bo">mani-dong</i>.
They were specially numerous in the
country through which I passed after leaving
Tachienlu, but there are many of them also in
the immediate neighbourhood of that town.
Lamaism shares with other forms of Buddhism
the rule that sacred objects should, as far as
possible, be kept on the right-hand side. Where
an obo or mani-drombo occurs, therefore, the
road always bifurcates so as to enable the devout
traveller to keep it on his right whichever way
he is going. The inscribed slabs are the pious
gifts of pilgrims, or of any person who wishes
to conciliate or show his respect to the unseen
powers. Every lamasery has among its inmates
one or two masons who are employed by such
persons in carving the inscriptions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHOICE OF ROUTE</div>

<p>Before reaching Tachienlu I had purposely left
undecided the route to be followed thereafter,
as I was only too well aware of the obstructions
which the authorities would be certain to put in
my way when I attempted to leave the main
routes. I had a vague idea of making an effort
to cross the frontier into Tibet proper, and so
proceeding to Lhasa by the route which no
European has traversed since the days of the
abbé Huc; but it soon became obvious that this
would be impossible&mdash;at least so long as a state
of war existed on the border. The Chinese
prefect had no doubt acquainted himself with
the fact that I was engaged in the study of
Tibetan, and when I called upon him he showed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
considerable anxiety and curiosity as to my intentions.
The new amban showing no eagerness to
avail himself of a unique opportunity to add a
British adviser to his staff, and the undertaking
being otherwise impossible in the face of Chinese
and Tibetan opposition, I was obliged to give
up the idea of a ride to Lhasa, and had to
fall back on my original intention of travelling
through the Sino-Tibetan states of the Yalung
valley to the north-west of Yunnan. If I
were prevented by official opposition from following
this route as well, I decided to return to
the Ta Tu river, and find my way down the
Chien-ch'ang valley to Yüeh-hsi and Ning-yuan-fu,
the route which has been made famous
by the journey of Marco Polo, and has been
in recent years traversed by E. C. Baber and
Sir A. Hosie. With regard to this route I
was told that the road was much infested by
robbers&mdash;Lolos and others&mdash;and that many of
the inn-keepers had entered into a league with
them to drug and rob, and, if necessary, murder
their visitors. There was only one way to avoid
molestation, and that was by the discovery and
use of the robbers' password. The utterance of
this word on appropriate occasions would not
only ensure safety, but would remove all difficulties
about transport and supplies. The person
(a Chinese in Government employment) who
gave me this information, and who may, for all
I know, have had personal dealings with the
gang, was so obliging as to give me the password
itself, which consisted, he said, of the
single word <i lang="zh">Ku</i> ("old"). As I did not, after all,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
follow this interesting route, and therefore had
no opportunity of testing the efficacy of the
word, I can only express the hope that the
timely information now given will be of service
to future travellers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE YALUNG VALLEY</div>

<p>The Yalung valley is one of the least-known
portions of the Chinese empire. In 1895-96
M. Bonin, a French Colonial official, travelled from
Tali-fu to Tachienlu by a route which to a certain
extent coincided with that taken by myself, and
three years later a Swedish missionary, Mr E.
Amundsen, travelled in the reverse direction by
a road which was evidently almost the same as
my own. But no Englishman<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> had traversed the
same route before me, and as I had no opportunity
of reading the narratives published by either M.
Bonin or Mr Amundsen until my return to civilisation,
I unfortunately derived no benefit from their
previous experience: but their accounts, though
interesting, are very meagre in detail and of
tantalising brevity.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> A glance at the map will
show that my route lay across the mountains to
the south-west of Tachienlu. On crossing the
Yalung it enters the Muli or Huang Lama, and
thence it crosses the Yunnan frontier a few
miles north of Yung-ning-fu. Short as the total
distance appears on the map, the series of great
mountain ranges over which the road passes
makes the journey a long one and arduous. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
few Yunnanese merchants<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> choose this route to
Ssuch'uan in order to avoid the likin-stations in
the Chien-ch'ang valley; but the great difficulties
of arranging for the safe transport of merchandise
over snowy passes and unbridged rivers have given
it a bad reputation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OFFICIAL OBSTRUCTION</div>

<p>Even at Tachienlu I was unable to gather
much information about the country. The king
himself appeared to have a very scanty knowledge
of the southern part of his own territory. As
soon as he and the Chinese prefect heard of my
intention&mdash;and it was impossible to conceal it from
them&mdash;the strongest objections were immediately
raised. The road was impassable, the mountains
were covered with snow that never melted, the
lamas were hostile, the whole country was infested
with robbers and wild beasts, and I should find
neither food nor means of transport. I had
already satisfied myself by private enquiry among
the Tibetans and some Yunnanese merchants
that the route was feasible, and that nothing was to
be feared beyond the ordinary difficulties and hardships
of travelling in a very wild region sparsely
populated. I felt that if the road were safe and
easy enough for an occasional trading caravan,
it should also be safe and easy enough for an
Englishman burdened with little beyond clothes
and gun. I therefore declined to put faith in the
exaggerated descriptions with which the officials
endeavoured to frighten me, and insisted upon the
right conferred upon me by my passport to travel
where I chose. We exchanged several messages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
on the subject, and in personal interviews I
made it as clear as possible that none of the
difficulties which they had mentioned seemed to
me sufficiently imposing to justify me in altering
the route on which I had determined. The
prefect, however, was particularly strenuous in
his efforts to dissuade me from my purpose, and
pointed out that he would be powerless to grant
me any protection during the journey, and that
the risks and dangers would be considerable. I
need hardly say that his concern was not for
me personally, but was due to his fears of what
might happen to himself in the event of my
coming to grief. From this point of view his
attitude was reasonable enough. The upshot of
a long discussion was that the king of Chala
and the prefect allowed me to set out on my
consenting to sign declarations in English and
Chinese to the effect that all responsibility for
my safety was to rest with myself. The first
of these declarations ran as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This is to certify that I have been
fully informed by the Ming Chêng Ssŭ
(king of Chala) that the road by which
I intend to travel from Tachienlu to the
borders of Yunnan, <i>viâ</i> the southern
portions of his territory and the country
known as Huang Lama, is beset with great
difficulties, and that my journey will be
very arduous and possibly dangerous.
Having been fully assured of these circumstances,
and having nevertheless decided to
traverse the country in question, I wish
it to be understood that I undertake the
journey at my own risk and on my own
responsibility, and that the king of Chala<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
is not to be held responsible for any delay or
accident that may occur in the course of such
journey so far as it lies within his territory."</p></blockquote>

<p>This document was handed to Mr Moyes, to
be used by him to save the king from blame in
the event of an accident. A similar declaration,
containing the name of the Chinese prefect instead
of that of the king, was handed directly to that
official before my departure. I perhaps created
an unwise precedent; but as the prefect seemed
determined to prevent my departure unless I relieved
him of all responsibility, I was left with no
option. The British Consular authorities, I knew,
would do nothing: they had already declined
to countenance my travelling by this route.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TIBETAN BORDER-LAND</div>

<p>The fears of the officials with regard to possible
dangers were in some respects justifiable. A
great part of the country between the Yalung
and the borders of Tibet proper was and is under
the direct or indirect control of lamas, who show
very little respect for Chinese suzerainty. It
was only recently that two French missionaries
were cruelly butchered by the lamas somewhere
near the Tali-Batang trade route; and a young
Scotsman named Forrest, who had been collecting
botanical specimens in the same locality,
only escaped with his life after being hunted by
the lamas with dogs, and suffering extraordinary
privations. The country into which my road
should lead me after crossing the Yalung was
also directly ruled by lamas; and while I was in
Tachienlu there were rumours to the effect that
the lama-prince of that region, though far from
the scene of actual fighting, was not only secretly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
supporting the rebels, but had caused the roads
in his territory to be torn up and blocked in
order to prevent the advance of Chinese reinforcements
from Yunnan. The war, indeed, was not
progressing altogether favourably for the Chinese.
It was whispered that on one occasion a whole
regiment had been cut to pieces during a night
attack. The Tibetans had eluded the sentries,
who were probably asleep, rushed the camp, put
out the fires, slaughtered many defenceless soldiers,
and then quietly vanished, leaving the Chinese to
shoot and stab each other in the extremity of their
panic. Other rumours stated that five hundred
Chinese troops had joined the Tibetans, and were
receiving from them twelve <i lang="zh">tiao</i> (about thirty
shillings) a month each&mdash;much larger pay than
they drew from China; and that the tributary
prince of Litang&mdash;the state that adjoins Chala
on the west&mdash;was only waiting to hear of another
serious reverse to the Chinese troops before throwing
in his lot with the rebels. Probably these
rumours were much exaggerated, but they caused
much uneasiness to the Chinese of Tachienlu, who
for a long time past had been living in constant
dread of a massacre. I heard that some time
before my arrival the Tibetans were expected to
attempt a great <i>coup</i> by making a sudden descent
on Tachienlu itself, and any Tibetan in the city
who was suspected of treasonable dealings with the
rebels was imprisoned or closely watched. The
principal Chinese merchants sent the bulk of their
goods to Wa Ssŭ Kou or Lu Ting Ch'iao, and were
ready to start for the east themselves at the first
signs of serious trouble. The worst of the panic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
had passed away before my arrival, chiefly owing
to the vigour and severity with which the Government
was dealing with the insurrection and the
large numbers of Chinese soldiers that almost daily
passed through Tachienlu on their way to the front.</p>

<p>Whether the prefect was sincere in his apprehensions
regarding my safety if I insisted on
crossing the wilder parts of the eastern Tibetan
states I have no means of knowing; at any rate,
he appeared to regard the written declaration
already quoted as sufficient to relieve him of all
responsibility in the matter; and as soon as that
question was settled, both he and the king showed
themselves ready to give me every reasonable
assistance, and placed no further obstacles in my
way. The king deputed a man of his own&mdash;a
Tibetan who spoke a little Chinese&mdash;to act as
my guide to the boundary of his territory on the
Yalung river, and the prefect and colonel ordered
three soldiers to escort me as far as the town of
Yung-ning, just within the Yunnan frontier. I
had also previously engaged a young man, whose
father was a Chinese and his mother a Tibetan
from Lhasa, to act as my personal servant, and
this youth accompanied me almost as far as the
frontier of Upper Burma. As a speaker of both
Tibetan and Chinese, he proved a useful member
of my party. The king was also obliging enough
to accord to me the valuable privilege of <i>ula</i>,
which would (within his territory) obviate all
difficulties about transport. The <i>ula</i> was in this
instance no hardship for the people, as I undertook
to pay more than double the ordinary rates
for all animals required for my use.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

<p class="center">TACHIENLU TO PA-U-RONG, YALUNG RIVER</p>

<p>I set out from Tachienlu on 15th April. My
caravan consisted of three mules to carry my
baggage and silver<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> (very light loads which in
level country might have been carried by a
single mule), two riding mules for myself and
my servant, and four for my escort. Half a mile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
beyond the city I crossed the stone bridge known
locally as the Gate of Tibet, close under the
walls of a gloomy lamasery, and entered the long
defile that leads into the heart of the great
mountains. The road gradually rose to a height
of about 2,250 feet above Tachienlu, and at the
hamlet of Chê-to&mdash;about 10,650 feet above sea-level,
and about 40 <i lang="zh">li</i> from Tachienlu&mdash;I found
a haven for the night in a ruinous hut.</p>

<p>As far as Chê-to my route followed the
Litang-Batang road that leads into Tibet proper,
and I met several yak caravans bringing goods
to Tachienlu. Outside my quarters at Chê-to
hung a proclamation in Chinese and Tibetan
informing the people that the insurrection of the
I-jên (barbarians) gave all good men a favourable
opportunity for proving their loyalty to Govern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>ment
by ready compliance with the regulations
about <i>ula</i>; but the dead bodies of no less than
four yaks lying by the road-side between
Tachienlu and Chê-to offered a grim comment
on the results of those regulations.</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="THE_GATE_OF_TIBET"></a>

<div class="caption">"THE GATE OF TIBET."</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">CHÊ RI PASS</div>

<p>At Chê-to my road left the caravan-route
and led into a wild region where during a day's
march I passed only one lonely house, near which
we encountered the only representative of the
local population&mdash;a sad-faced old woman sitting
astride a mottled yak. The day's journey (the
second stage from Tachienlu) was long and
arduous. The road from Chê-to rose steadily,
but not steeply, through a confined valley, following
the left bank of a stream. About midday
we were picking our way laboriously through
deep snow, and early in the afternoon we reached
the summit of the pass of Chê Ri La, 17,400 feet
above the sea-level.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> The pass is a double one,
the two summits being divided by a long valley
which appears to have been at one time the
bed of a glacier.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> High as we were, there were
peaks in the north-east that still towered several
thousand feet above us, and to the south and south-west
we saw nothing but a vast ocean of billowy
mountains with innumerable trough-like valleys.
The descent was a difficult one on account of
the snow, which was almost too deep for our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
mules, one of which fell never to rise again. A
fertile valley opened before us as we descended,
and we soon struck the right bank of a stream
flowing down from the snows of the range we
had just crossed. A beautiful forest of firs
covered the slopes on the eastern side. About
3,000 feet below the summit we came upon the
first signs of human habitation&mdash;a herd of yak.
Five <i lang="zh">li</i> further we came to a few cultivated fields
and a large two-storied house, which proved to
be the beginning of the straggling hamlet of
A Te, where we spent the night. In this valley
the high peaks are all hidden, and though its
elevation is about 13,000 feet the gently-sloping
hills are well forested. Here for the first time
I caught sight of the great white pheasant known
as the machi.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CHINESE TIBET</div>

<p>This day's march was a fair sample of our
daily toil for the next few weeks. It was a continuous
march up and down the snowy or forest-clad
slopes of the loftiest mountains in China;
and no doubt the journey would have been
monotonous and arduous enough had it not
been for the magnificence of the ever-changing
scenery. The food which I shared with my
followers was of the roughest and plainest. We
lived almost entirely on <i lang="bo">tsamba</i>&mdash;parched barley-meal,
mixed with yak butter and the peculiar
concoction which the Tibetans believe to be tea,
and kneaded by one's own fingers into a thick
paste. Occasionally&mdash;for I had to be very sparing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
of my cartridges&mdash;I contributed a pheasant to the
table, and in two or three places we were able
to buy goats. The goats trotted along with our
caravan until we were hard up for food, and then
they trotted no longer. White pigeons were
numerous in the deeper valleys. Villages were
very few&mdash;we seldom passed more than two in
a day, and sometimes none at all, and as a rule
they were nothing but the sorriest hamlets. We
were generally able, however, to arrange our stages
in such a way that we could spend the night
under cover. We had no tent, and the nights
were always too bitterly cold for sleeping out of
doors. I was clothed in thick Peking furs, and
wore boots lined with sheep-skin. During the day
I wore smoked glasses to protect my eyes from
snow-blindness. A couple of extra pairs I lent
to two of my escort, and the rest wore the yak-hair
eye-shade which the Tibetans call <i lang="bo">mig-ra</i>.
We found the villagers friendly and hospitable,
and we never had any difficulty in getting
accommodation when we came to a hamlet; and
as we paid well for all supplies&mdash;a matter
which sometimes caused evident surprise&mdash;we
were always given the best that the village
could produce or could spare. I did not meet
a single Chinese between Chê-to and Li-chiang
in Yunnan<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a>&mdash;a journey that occupied about
a month&mdash;and the Chinese language was entirely
unknown.</p>

<p>Tibetan houses are gloomy stone buildings with
small windows, and the rooms are both dark and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
dirty. I was sometimes grateful to the darkness
for concealing some of the dirt, but my sense
of smell unfortunately remained painfully acute.
The windows are necessarily small, as paper is
too scarce to be used as a protection against
the wind, and glass is of course unknown. The
apparent size of the houses is deceptive. A building
that presents the outward appearance of a
substantial two-or three-storied dwelling-house
with many rooms, shrinks into a dismal and
draughty collection of stables, courtyards, and
dungeon-like living-rooms, when one gets inside.
As often as not, the greater part of the ground-floor
is used as a cattle-shed, and off this a short
passage leads into the family common-room. The
upstairs rooms&mdash;reached by clambering up a block
of wood, with carved notches to serve as steps&mdash;are
generally only granaries and barns, full of
beasts that crawl and bite. In some cases I was
provided with the luxury of a room to myself; but
more often I had to share the living-room with
men, women, children, and disagreeable animals
that love the night. My slumbers would certainly
have been unpleasantly disturbed if I had been
less worn out at the end of each day's journey.
There are no fire-places or chimneys. The fire
is kindled in the middle of the room, and the
smoke escapes by the door and windows or through
holes in the wall, but much of it does not escape
at all, and the effect is trying to the eyes; while
the black streaky soot, that clings to the walls and
hangs on spiders' webs dangling from the roof,
adds to the general effect of gloom and discomfort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">TIBETAN TEA</div>

<p>On arriving at our destination each night, we all
crowded round the fire and consumed our <i lang="bo">tsamba</i>,
while our hostess exercised a pair of muscular
arms in vigorously stirring up our tea and butter
in a big wooden churn,<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> whence she ladled it
out into a big pot, from which each of us poured
what he wanted into his own bowl. Tibetan tea&mdash;made
of the twigs of the tea-plant, and its
coarsest leaves&mdash;has been much maligned: I
always found it drinkable if one added plenty of
butter and forgot it was meant to be tea. If as
tea it is horrible, as a soup it is almost agreeable.
The yak-butter, taken by itself, is insipid and
unpleasant; but the Tibetans can make a kind
of cream-cheese out of it, and I found this fairly
good when I could get nothing better. Conversation
with my kind hosts was apt to be stilted,
even with the assistance of my semi-Tibetan
boy. Fortunately my bull-terrier formed a topic
of never-failing interest. His three simple tricks
had delighted the genial monks of Mount Omei
and the village children of central Ssuch'uan, and
indeed his mere appearance&mdash;so different from that
of Chinese dogs&mdash;had filled them with wonder;
but when the simple herdsmen of the Yalung
valley saw the strange foreign beast lying down
at the word of command, or sitting on his hind
legs and balancing a lump of <i lang="bo">tsamba</i> on the end
of his nose, the prevailing feeling seemed to be
something not very far removed from religious
awe.</p>

<p>Every valley seemed to have a dialect of its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
own, and occasionally my servant found it hard to
make himself understood. As none of my hosts
appeared to have heard of England, it was difficult
to satisfy their curiosity about myself, and I fear
they often failed to understand what I meant by
saying that my country was outside the Chinese
empire, and that it had an emperor all to itself.
On the whole, I was far less troubled by the
inquisitiveness and curiosity of the people than
in China proper: and, indeed, I was glad to find
that the three soldiers who formed my Chinese
escort were often regarded with greater curiosity
than I was myself. The children appeared to look
upon us as a new kind of wild beast, and I fear
we often unwittingly brought tears to their eyes.
Our mules were changed, under the rules of the
<i>ula</i> system, at nearly every village. A riding-mule
was generally procurable for myself, though as a
rule I performed at least half the day's journey
on foot. When mules were unobtainable we
employed yaks, and if yaks were not to be had
my baggage was carried by Tibetan men, and still
more frequently by women. This last circumstance
was a source of great gratification to my three
soldiers, who hardly knew more Tibetan than I did
myself, but were never at a loss in exchanging
lively banter with the damsels who accompanied
us. Once or twice I was seized with the unworthy
suspicion that the village patriarchs were careful
to entrust us with only the least attractive of
their women-folk: otherwise, I was at a loss to
account for the circumstance that whereas every
Tibetan village possessed several good-looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
girls, the women who carried our baggage were
almost invariably plain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PEOPLE</div>

<p>The people of eastern Tibet are totally unlike
the Chinese in appearance, though the extraordinary
mixture of races produces a large variety of
types. As a rule, the men are tall, very well made,
with well-marked features, noses of European
shape, and eyelids that are often quite free from
the peculiarity which produces in many Eastern
races the well-known appearance of an obliquity
of the eyes. As specimens of vigorous, stalwart
manhood they are much more noteworthy than
the people of Lhasa and Central Tibet. They are
born mountaineers and have healthy, well-bronzed
faces. Sometimes, indeed, they are as dark in
complexion as the Burmese.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> They wear goat-skin
or yak-skin clothes, and well-lined leather
boots, reaching nearly to their knees, that protect
their feet from snow and frost-bite. Most of
them are attired in a garment that might be
regarded as the prototype of the Scots kilt. The
women wear skirts, and, as their feet are of course
unbound, they do not walk with the mincing gait
of the lily-footed lady of China. I have been
told by persons who take an interest in the human
form that the average woman of Chinese Tibet is
decidedly handsome. It is unfortunate that she
does not often wash her face. She is certainly
more genial and vivacious than the quiet and
timid Chinese woman. She climbs mountains as
nimbly as her husband, and the loads she carries
are just as heavy; nor does she hesitate to join<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
in amiable conversation with her husband's male
friends when she meets them on the road.</p>

<p>Marco Polo, who only touched the fringe of
the Tibetan countries, describes in his naïve way
some of the peculiar social customs of the people
of those lands "as a good story to tell, and
to show what a fine country that is for young
fellows to go to";<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> and a much later traveller&mdash;Cooper&mdash;amusingly
describes how he unexpectedly
found that he had gone through a
ceremony of marriage with a Tibetan damsel
when he innocently thought that he was merely
having a picnic under a grove of walnut trees.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a>
No such hymeneal experience fell to my lot,
though walnut trees were common enough in
the deep valleys. Nor am I able to endorse
Marco Polo's somewhat hasty criticism that the
Tibetans are "an evil generation, holding it
no sin to rob and maltreat: in fact they are the
greatest brigands on earth." I took no special
care of my money and baggage, yet I never met
a robber, and never&mdash;so far as I am aware&mdash;lost
even a handful of <i lang="bo">tsamba</i>. "These people of
Tibet are an ill-conditioned race. They have
mastiff dogs as big as donkeys." This further
remark of Messer Marco's is nearer the truth if
we take "ill-conditioned" to mean "unclean," and
allow for a considerable exaggeration about the
size of the dogs. No Tibetan household is complete
without one or two of those uncouth animals.
The breed has changed since Marco's day, for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
dogs are not mastiffs (though these are still well
known throughout Tibet proper), but a large long-haired
dog that somewhat resembles a collie. They
are exceedingly savage towards strangers and of
great value as watch-dogs. Their physical strength
is enormous. The usual custom is to allow them
to go loose at night and to chain them up in the
yard or in front of the house during the day, the
theory apparently being that any one who wanders
out of doors after nightfall must be a knave, and
deserves any ill-fate that may befall him. Their
bark is most peculiar: not sharp and crisp like
that of most European dogs, but with a sepulchral
and "far-away" sound as if each dog kept his own
ghost in his stomach and it was only the ghost that
barked.</p>
<div class="sidenote">MOUNTAIN FLORA</div>

<p>The villages are surrounded by fields which&mdash;considering
the great elevation of even the
deepest valleys&mdash;are wonderfully productive. In
many cases, where the valleys are very narrow, the
cultivated land has all been reclaimed from virgin
forest. Up to 10,000 feet, and in some places at
greater elevations, there is a good deal of wheat
and maize; in sheltered valleys, buckwheat, oats,
beans, peas and barley are cultivated with considerable
success up to over 13,000 feet. The
mountain flora surprised me immensely by its
richness and variety. Wild-flowers&mdash;many of
them quite unknown to England and perhaps to
Europe&mdash;grew luxuriantly in the deep ravines into
which we dipped between the parallel ranges, and
the mountain slopes up to 14,000 feet at least were
generally covered with immense primeval forests<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
of pine and fir. In the great forests the pine was
the first to die out on the higher levels; the fir
asserted itself to 2,000 or 3,000 feet higher, and the
hardiest of all was the tree-rhododendron, which I
have seen growing at a greater height than 16,000
feet. There is some variation in the line of perpetual
snow on the different ranges and even on
the two sides of the same range; on an average
it was not below 16,500 feet, though there were
several passes at a lower elevation on which I was
told the snow only disappeared for two or three
months in the summer.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> Next to the pines and
firs the commonest trees are other coniferæ such
as the spruce and juniper, and evergreens such as
the yew and cypress. Among deciduous trees the
poplar,<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> horse-chestnut and wild cherry are common
at heights varying from 8,000 to 12,000 feet. The
Chinese oak (<i lang="la">quercus sinensis</i>), which has evergreen
leaves, is also to be met with very frequently.
Besides the rhododendron there are many hardy
shrubs to be found at elevations almost as great,
such as brambles, <i>aucuba</i>, the viburnum, artemisia,
a kind of hydrangea, the clematis, and wild-gooseberry.
The wild-flowers are naturally not numerous
on the summits of the lofty ranges, but in the
neighbourhood of the banks of the Yalung and
other rivers and in the warmer valleys I found
innumerable flowering plants to which, had I been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
a botanical expert, I should have been glad to put
names, but which were, after all, quite as beautiful
nameless. The familiar plants included wild
roses, edelweiss, gentian, spiræa, and several varieties&mdash;some
almost certainly unknown to botanists&mdash;of
the primula.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BIG GAME</div>

<p>Had my principal object in visiting these
remote mountains been to study their fauna or to
shoot big game, I should no doubt have been
amply rewarded for my toil; but, as it was, I
cannot say much of the country from a sportsman's
point of view, for I carried no rifle, and shot
only to supply the needs of my frugal table.
Most of the wild animals kept well out of my
way, and I did not go in search of them. The
musk-deer and horned stags are common denizens
of the mountains, and there are also the wolf, fox,
antelope, bear, panther,<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> wild ass, wild goat and
wild sheep. Sometimes, when camping in the forest&mdash;which
we had to do several times after crossing
the Yalung&mdash;my followers insisted upon keeping
up a big fire all night, and begged me to discharge
my gun once at least to frighten away the beasts of
prey. This precaution was judged necessary on
account of the mules, which on such occasions were
turned loose to find their own fodder. Instinct
apparently prevented them from wandering far
from the camp, for we never had the least difficulty
about catching them in the morning.</p>

<p>The heights of the passes which we crossed
varied between 12,000 and 17,500 feet, and some
of them were above the line of perpetual snow.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
The climbing was sometimes very steep work,
but it never became really difficult except on the
few occasions when we experienced high winds
and snow-storms. The cold was then so intense
that the thickest furs did not afford adequate
protection. The rarefied air made rapid motion
impossible, and prevented one from getting warm
through exercise. The mules stopped to recover
breath at intervals of a hundred yards, and though
I never suffered from the least trace of mountain-sickness
I often found walking strangely laborious.
We made slow progress, of course, sometimes
not more than 10 or 12 miles in a day, but
nearly every stage took us from dawn to sunset
to accomplish. The tops of the passes were generally
sharp ridges, in some cases culminating
in a sheer wall of frozen snow and ice through
which my men had to dig out a path for the
mules and for ourselves. Stone cairns (<i lang="bo">lab ch'a</i>)
surmounted by sticks and rags crown the summit
of every pass; they were always greeted by
my men with shouts of joy, and sometimes
they added a stone to the cairn or tied an extra
bit of rag to one of the protruding sticks.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
the steep descents were sometimes quite as
arduous and dangerous as the upward climbs,
especially when it was necessary&mdash;owing to the
excessive steepness&mdash;to descend in zig-zags, or
when a miniature avalanche tore down in our
direction bringing stones and boulders in its frozen
clutches.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PLEASURES OF TRAVEL</div>

<p>But, on the whole, I found the difficulties of
this almost unknown route by no means so
serious as I had been led to expect. I never
for a moment regretted that I had so obstinately
declined to be guided by the timid officials at
Tachienlu, and never found myself without a
good reserve of strength and energy at the end
of every day's march. I should be indeed sorry
if my description of the route should deter others
from undertaking the same journey. Granted
health, strength, a first-rate digestion, and an
average fund of cheerfulness, there is no reason
whatever why any of my readers who longs to
behold Nature in her supreme glory should not
forthwith pack up his hand-bag&mdash;he should take
little else&mdash;and follow in my steps with a light
heart. Would that I could bear him company:
for the spirits of the mountain and the forest
never cease, in hours of solitude, to haunt the
mind of him who has known them once and
learned something of their spell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span></p>

<p>The reader who does not propose to undertake
any such expedition may be recommended to glance
but lightly at many of the pages that follow. The
details of my daily march through the mountains
of Chinese Tibet to the borders of Yunnan will
hardly be of interest to any but those who are
themselves travellers or are contemplating a
journey of a similar kind.</p>

<p>My route from Tachienlu to the frontier of
Yunnan may be divided for descriptive purposes
into three sections: the first, from Tachienlu to
the village of Pa-U-Rong, on the banks of the
Yalung or Nya Ch'u, occupying eleven days; the
second, from the west bank of the Yalung to the
lamasery of Muli, seven days; and the third, from
Muli to Yung-ning in north-western Yunnan,
three days.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OCTAGONAL TOWERS</div>

<p>Of the first section, the two first stages from
Tachienlu have already been described. On the
third day from Tachienlu (17th April), my road
led in a most tortuous manner through three
long valleys, fairly well populated and sprinkled
with villages. The first village, about 3 miles
from A Te, is Du Sz Drung, situated at the
point where the road emerges from the first and
turns into the second valley&mdash;the direction as far
as Du Sz Drung being south-west, and thereafter
almost due west. Opposite the next village of
Dza Ri K'u is a conspicuous conical hill; a little
further on the valley (lying N.N.E. and W.S.W.)
becomes very much broader, and is dotted with
several isolated houses and a village named Ring
I Drung. Here we changed <i>ula</i>. Immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
afterwards, we struck off to the south into the
third valley, keeping to the left bank of a stream
named the Dja Ki Ch'u. In the villages of these
valleys I observed several cases of goitre, a
complaint which is common in the highlands of
Ssuch'uan and the lofty tableland of Yunnan.
Curious octagonal stone towers, now seen for
the first time, are a conspicuous feature in the
landscape of both these valleys. The towers
which are described by Gill<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> as existing further
north in the country explored by him are evidently
of the same pattern. Baber, who knew of them
only from Gill's account, has made the following
observations on the subject. "What the use of
these buildings may have been is unknown, but
the presumption is that they were watch-towers;
for the present purpose it is enough to know that
they are universally said to have been erected by
the Menia, and that there is nothing resembling
them west of the Yalung on the main road."<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a>
My own observation corroborates the information
given to Baber. I passed a large number of the
towers, but none further west than Ri Wa, which
was still five days' journey from the Yalung by my
route. All were built on the same plan, and have
eight corners, as shown in the ground plan on the
following page. That they were used as watch-towers
and beacon-stations is highly probable, for
they are generally placed in positions from which
the watchers would have an uninterrupted view
up and down the valleys; but as I observed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
several of them close together, when one would
have been sufficient according to the watch-tower
theory, it is probable that they must have been
used also as fortresses. At the advance of an
enemy the tribesmen very likely drove their
cattle and other animals into the large room on
the ground floor,<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> and used the upper stories
for their own protection.</p><div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_208.jpg" alt="Plan of tower" /></div><p>Missiles could be
discharged from the roof
and from the narrow
holes that served also as
windows: just as was the
case with the old peel-towers
of the Scottish
border. I explored several
of the towers, but found
no inscriptions. They are
nearly all in a dilapidated
condition, but some have been kept in good
preservation and are used as granaries and store-houses.
In one case at least the tower has been
made to serve as the wing of a modern house of
the ordinary Tibetan type, and the interior has
been partially reconstructed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="OCTAGONAL_TOWER"></a>
<img src="images/i_170fp.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">OCTAGONAL TOWER AT RI WA.</div>
</div>

<p>Two or three miles of easy riding through
the third valley brought us to a curious wooden
bridge by which we crossed the Dja Ki Ch'u,
which, having been joined by several tributaries
at the intersection of the valleys, was now a
fairly large river. It joins the Yalung, but its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
valley is apparently impracticable for travellers,
for our road soon left its banks. We had
changed <i>ula</i> for the second time at Ring I
Drung,<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> and we did so again at a place called
Ba Lu, where there is a single hut. At last,
after a march of about 16 miles for the day,
we put up at a solitary house named P'un Bu
Shi. The valley here lies N.N.E. and S.S.W.
Just beyond our quarters, on the left bank of
the river, a small tributary descended from a
valley, containing some houses, in the south-east.
Leaving this valley on our left we continued the
next day to keep to the valley of the Dja Ki
Ch'u, which, however, twice changes its name
during the day's march. We soon passed a conspicuous
ruined tower a couple of hundred feet
above the road on our (the right) bank of the
river. The lofty mountains were all invisible,
and the hills that bounded our valley were
smooth and low, with plenty of pasturage and a
fair amount of forestation. In one small area I
noticed sheep, goats, yak, ponies and pigs all
pasturing together, and all apparently on the
most amiable terms with one another.</p>


<div class="sidenote">DEFORESTATION</div>

<p>A second tower, higher up than the first,
stands about 2 <i lang="zh">li</i> beyond the latter. About a
mile beyond this the valley narrows to a gorge,
where cultivation ceases. The name of the river
at this point was given to me as A-mi-chi-ts'a,
which is also apparently a name of the people
who inhabit the westerly end of the valley. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
the gorge the lower slopes were well wooded,
but a good deal of tree-felling was going on.
The abundance of timber makes the people
wasteful, for they selected their trees with an
obvious disregard of their age or condition. For
about 20 <i lang="zh">li</i> we went through the forest by a
winding path and then crossed the river by a
well-made wooden bridge of the same peculiar
construction as that crossed on the previous day.
This brought us to the left bank of the river,
which in this locality is known as the Li Ch'u.
Very soon afterwards, emerging from the gorge,
we came to a solitary house at the entrance to
a valley which lies approximately south-east and
north-west. We took our frugal midday meal
of <i lang="bo">tsamba</i> in the cottage, then, leaving the Li
Ch'u, which we never saw again, we proceeded
in a south-easterly direction up the new valley,
down which flows a rather large stream, the
Tsa Ch'u. A rough road wound in and out
amid well-wooded and picturesque scenery for
a distance of about 5 miles, till we found ourselves
opposite a large house on an eminence
overlooking our valley, and at the entrance to
another valley lying in a south-westerly direction.
The house we found to be the residence of a
<i lang="zh">t'u pai hu</i>, or sub-chief, who received us very
cheerfully and provided us with comfortable
quarters for the night.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TAN GA PASS</div>

<p>For two days our route had been an easy one,
lying as it did through a series of river-valleys.
The next day our toils began again. We left
the hospitable headman's house on a brilliantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
fine but cold morning. There had been hard
frost during the night, and the still waters were
coated with ice when we started. Proceeding up
the new valley towards the south, we gradually
ascended for a few miles till we reached a
beautiful level glade from which we had a fine
view of dense pine forests that covered the hills
on both sides almost to their summits. Another
short climb brought us to a point from which
we began the ascent of the pass of Tan Ga
La.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> We changed <i>ula</i> at the hamlet of Sho Ti
Ba Dze at its foot. After another 3 miles or
so the hills began to close us in on every
side and the ascent began to be steep. The
mountain is wooded up to the summit of the
pass (15,000 feet), which we reached about midday.
The descent began at once and abruptly,
and was at first very steep. We descended about
3,000 feet into a wooded gorge where machi
and other game-fowl abound. We then entered
a valley of which the direction (E.N.E. and
W.S.W.) was at right angles to that through
which we had descended. A large brook flowed
through it in a westerly direction, and, rather to
my surprise, our road led us along its right bank
towards the east. A walk of half a mile brought
us to the hamlet of Tu or Lu Li, where we
spent the night. I found lodging in a barn.
The people seemed more afraid of us than was
usually the case, and did not greet us with open
arms; but they made up for their cold reception<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
of us by increased friendliness later on. The
valley is broad and fertile enough for cultivation.
As usual, the principal grain is the Tibetan barley
(Chinese <i lang="zh">ch'ing k'o</i>), from which <i lang="bo">tsamba</i> is made.
The dialect spoken differed considerably from that
we had heard spoken in the morning only a few
miles away. The valleys in this wild region are
so sharply separated one from another that their
inhabitants must always have formed more or less
isolated communities; thus the rapid changes of
dialect are not surprising.</p>

<p>Starting at daylight next morning a few
hundred yards' walk brought us to the end of
the cultivated part of the valley. We followed
the right bank of a stream, the road gradually
turning S.S.E. We then crossed to the left
bank by a wooden bridge. After proceeding for
3 miles through a gorge we entered a plain several
miles broad, and the road turned due south. Half
a mile's further walk brought us through the
hamlet of Dro Dze Drung (or San Chia-tzŭ) to
that of Na K'i (or Hsia Ch'êng-tzŭ), where
we changed <i>ula</i>. On the hillside on the right
of the road I noticed some small caves. They
are artificial, but bear no resemblance to those
of the Min river, and are said to be used as
herdsmen's shelters. Near these two villages
are clusters of prayer-flags marking the site
of a graveyard. The people of this region
frequently&mdash;as already mentioned<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a>&mdash;dispose of
their dead by cremation. The scenery now
becomes much wilder and the forest almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
ceases, giving place to rugged rock. After going
S.S.W. for 2 miles, we reached the village of
Dra Shê, where we again changed <i>ula</i>. This
village is very poor and semi-ruinous. The
longest obo or <i lang="bo">mani-dong</i><a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> I had yet seen lay
between the villages of Na K'i and Dra Shê.
Another mile or so brought us to the dilapidated
hamlet of Ri Wa (Chinese Wu Chia-tzŭ<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a>), where
I saw the last of the octagonal towers.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> Soon
afterwards we reached the end of our stage at a
hamlet of three houses named Ko Ri Drung
(Chinese Chung Ku). The stage was a short
one, but I learned that no shelter was to be
obtained further on. This I ascertained to be
the case next morning, when we commenced the
ascent of the great pass of Dji Dju La. Our
path, lying S.S.W., climbed the right bank of a
stream by the side of a gaunt and jagged range
of precipitous mountains. The only vegetation
consisted of a few stunted trees near our path,
and not a shrub was visible on the black flanks
and snow-crowned summits of the hills. But as
we ascended the lower slopes of the pass, the
path wound into one ravine after another, and
in their sheltered depths I noticed large numbers
of coniferous trees and rhododendrons. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
last few hundred feet of the pass were deep in
snow, and along the ridge of the summit (at a
height of about 17,500 feet) we were faced by
a pointed wall of ice. From Ko Ri Drung to
the summit&mdash;a climb that kept us busily occupied
for the greater part of the day&mdash;there is no house
and no cultivation. From the pass there was a
grand view of snowy summits on both sides,
and I was told by our yak-drivers that the pass
itself is never free from snow. An icy west wind
met us as we reached the top: so cold that it
seemed as though it must have swept over all
the frozen mountain-tops of eastern Tibet. The
first part of the descent is steep. Lower down
it becomes easier, and for about 10 miles we
went south and south-west through a forest of
firs. The weather changed for the worse as we
descended, and for four hours we had to grope
our way through a blinding snow-storm. After
a very arduous day's march of over twelve hours'
duration we were glad to find a resting-place at
last in the comparatively large village of Dur
(Chinese Hei Lao), where I found roomy but
draughty quarters in the house of a sub-chief or
<i lang="zh">t'u pai hu</i>, who had gone to Tachienlu. I was
told by his wife, who entertained us, that he had
gone to prosecute a lawsuit which had already
been dragging on for two generations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THREE PASSES</div>

<p>The upland valley in which this village lies
is known as Dji Dju Rong. Part of it, if I
mistake not, is the bed of an extinct glacier. It
was still snowing when we set out next morning.
For about 3 miles we retraced our steps of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
previous day, then crossed and left the stream
that comes down from the Dji Dju La range
and found ourselves in a beautiful open glade. It
is a small flat plain, affording good pasture-land
for a herd of yaks, and surrounded on all sides
by forests and enormous mountains. It contains
three log-cabins. From here our road lay W.S.W.,
and we struck up into the mountains again to the
pass known as Wu Shu (or Shih) La. The forest
accompanied us nearly all the way to the summit,
the height of which is about 15,500 feet. The
ascent is steep at first, then very gradual, and
finally steep again near the top. The forest met
us again on the other side, and through it we
descended to the village of Wu Shu. The stage
was a short one, probably not more than 11 miles.
The scenery about Wu Shu is extremely beautiful.
Close by the village are the remains of a ruin on
a mound. It may have been an octagonal tower
but it was impossible to identify it as such.</p>

<p>The ground was covered with snow and it was
still snowing heavily when we started next day
(23rd April) on what proved to be on the whole
the severest day's march which I experienced
throughout the whole of my long journey. We
began a stiff climb almost immediately, and going
south and south-west reached the summit of the
first pass (Sin Go La), after a straight pull of about
5 miles. The elevation was about 15,000 feet.
Before we reached the top the snow ceased to
fall, and the weather for the rest of the day was
brilliantly fine. From the summit we had a
glorious view of lofty peaks towering far above<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
the highest limit of the thick forests. We
descended about 2,000 feet into a shallow ravine,
from the further side of which we mounted about
3,000 feet to the second pass, Nai Yu La, about
16,000 feet. On the further side of this pass we
descended very gradually to a confined valley,
where we crossed a frozen brook and started to
climb a third pass, Hlan Go La, the height of
which is about 17,200 feet. This was the longest
and most arduous climb of all.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"FAIRIES' SCARF"</div>

<p>I observed that on the sloping sides of the
ravines dividing these three ranges hundreds of
acres of forest-land had been cruelly devastated
by fire. During my journey from Tachienlu
to Yunnan nothing puzzled me more than the
extraordinary frequency of the forest fires, which
must have destroyed many thousands of acres
of magnificent timber. The natives say they are
caused by careless travellers, who leave the glowing
embers of their camp fires to be scattered
by the wind; but, as many of the fires commence
and burn themselves out in pathless regions where
neither natives nor travellers ever set foot, the
explanation was obviously unsatisfactory. Serious
as the fires are, the forests have to contend with an
enemy even more dangerous. No traveller in this
region can fail to notice the pale green moss that
swathes itself round the trunks and branches of
firs and pines, and hangs in graceful festoons from
tree to tree. This is the parasitic lichen known
to botanists as <i lang="la">usnea barbata</i>, and popularly as
the "fairies' scarf," which dooms any tree once
caught in its pendulous net to gradual decay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
and ignominious death. In many places I saw
hundreds of fine trees&mdash;the parasite attacks
young trees as well as old&mdash;stark and dead,
stripped of their bark, as if they had been struck
by lightning, but still draped with the vampire-like
lichen that had sucked them dry. It seems
to spread rapidly from one tree to another; its
streamers are sometimes several yards long, and in
a dense forest it only requires a moderate breeze to
blow the loose end of a streamer from a tree that
is already dying to its still vigorous neighbour;
and so the disease spreads. Apparently the only
way to protect the forests would be to cut a "fire-belt"
round every group of trees that had been
attacked, and so isolate it from the rest. But
forestry is an unknown science in the Chinese
empire, and the Government does not seem to
realise the value of its neglected forests. For
want of a better explanation of the forest fires I
hazard the suggestion that they may be caused
spontaneously by friction between the dry
branches of adjoining trees that have been killed
by the "fairies' scarf."</p>

<p>The descent from the pass of Hlan Go La into
the ravine below was steep and long. A large
level plain occurs during the descent, and it is
after traversing it that the descent becomes
steepest. We found shelter for the night, after
a very arduous march, in Gur Dja (Chinese Yin
Cho), a hamlet of log-huts. Clearances have been
made in the valley just below (for the hamlet is
perched on the side of a ravine), and there are a
few fields of barley and buckwheat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span></p>

<p>Next day we again retraced our steps to a
distance of 2 or 3 miles. Then we crossed the
ravine and commenced a climb on the opposite
side. As usual our climb lay at first through
forest, then we plunged into the snow, and found
it deeper and more troublesome than on any
of the other passes. At about 16,500 feet we
reached the summit of the pass known as Ri Go
La. The descent was sudden and steep, not
without its exciting moments, and we lost a
mule. We proceeded downwards in a southerly
and south-westerly direction and re-entered the
forest. Thence we descended several thousand
feet into a deep ravine. By the afternoon we had
left the snows behind us and entered into a
region characterised by a luxuriance of vegetation
that was almost tropical. Among other plants
and grasses there were great clusters of bamboo&mdash;fragile
and feathery, and so thin that it could be
bent between two fingers. It was also pleasant
to come upon beautiful beds of primroses and
flowering shrubs. As we neared the end of the
stage we met with a light shower of rain&mdash;a sure
sign that we were at a comparatively low elevation
and drawing near the valley of the Yalung. The
village of Pei T'ai, where we spent the night, lay
at an elevation of about 10,000 feet. Just before
reaching it we had a short climb of 800 or 1,000
feet over the small pass of Pu Ti La, which gave
us no trouble. The village of Pei T'ai is the
proud possessor of three gilded pinnacles which
adorn the roof of a miniature lamasery. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
headman's house, in which I was entertained,
almost adjoins it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PA-U-RONG</div>

<p>The next day's march was the last stage to
the Yalung. We began by descending a rough
path from the eminence which is crowned by
the village. Our road then led up and down
the south side of a deep ravine, with many
tortuous windings. The path&mdash;such as it was&mdash;had
in some places been torn away by recent
landslips. Wild-flowers and wild fruit-trees were
in blossom, and the young vegetation was delightfully
fresh and green. Squirrels were common,
and we caught sight of some beautiful long-tailed
green parrots. A steep path led us down to a
confined valley named Lan Yi Pa, and outside
its solitary hut we stopped for our midday meal.
The woman of the house, with a nose quick to
scent the proximity of untold wealth, hastened to
offer me, on bended knee, a present of three eggs.
From here the road led steeply to the crest of a
hill, and after turning several corners we found
ourselves in full view of the noble waters of the
Yalung.</p>

<p>When we reached a projecting corner of the
road at a spot called Hsin Yi La, I was requested
by the <i>ula</i> people to fire a shot from my gun in
the direction of the village of Pa-U-Rong, which
now lay at our feet and was in full view. This
I did, on learning that it was a custom with
which all travellers approaching Pa-U-Rong were
expected to comply. The village, with its comparatively
rich fields, has often been the prey of
mountain robbers, and any travellers who approach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
without giving a warning signal are presumed to
be coming with no good intent, and may find
all the inhabitants of the valley fully clad in the
panoply of war, ready to give them a hostile
reception. From the spot where I fired the
warning gun the road again descended steeply,
but after crossing a deep gully we found ourselves
in the large village of Pa-U-Rong, and
were received by the people with friendly faces.</p>

<p>The valley slopes gradually towards the river,
and, though it is of small area, it is thoroughly
well cultivated with wheat, barley and other
grain, and several kinds of vegetables. The
actual banks of the river are very steep, and
on them there is no cultivation. The level of
Pa-U-Rong is about 7,700 feet, and the river,
which has a considerable rise and fall, is on an
average about 200 feet lower. The village&mdash;with
two or three scattered suburbs in other parts
of the valley&mdash;contains a population of perhaps
two thousand, and was the largest and most
prosperous centre of population we had come
across since leaving Tachienlu.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MOUNTAINS AND SNOW</div>

<p>We had now descended, for the time being,
from the icy heights of the Chinese Alps, and
were in a region of green vegetation and tranquil
beauty. But the snowy peaks and passes were
still in full view, and amid the rich scenery that
now surrounded me it was the wild splendour
of the mountains, and the snow, and the dark
primeval forests that haunted me still. The
scenery through which I had passed was not of
the kind that could be looked at, admired and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
then forgotten. The purple crags and jewelled
peaks rising in sombre majesty from the white
slopes of the sun-lit snow-fields were sights upon
which one might gaze from dawn till dark and
ever find new treasures of beauty, and which,
when the eye had once seen, the mind could
never forget. Surely our great prose-poet&mdash;never
more full of enthusiasm and spiritual insight
than when describing the glories of his beloved
Alps&mdash;spoke with truth when he told us that in
the whole range of inorganic nature there could
perhaps be found no object "more perfectly
beautiful than a fresh, deep snow-drift, seen
under warm light."<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> But, as Ruskin well knew,
it is the dark setting of rock and crag that
lends so rare a beauty to wide stretches of
untrodden snow. The wild and desolate aspects
of nature have indeed a charm that is different
in kind from that which belongs to sylvan or
merely "pretty" scenery, for they touch profounder
depths in our nature than can be reached
by the faery beauty of dale and wood and
running water. The feelings they excite can
only be compared to the deepest religious emotions
of which our nature is capable. "Surely,
if beauty be an object of worship," said Tyndall,
"those glorious mountains, with rounded shoulders
of the purest white&mdash;snow-crested and star-gemmed&mdash;were
well calculated to excite sentiments
of adoration."<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> Thus it is that in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
presence of Nature's holiest shrines it is generally
best to be alone. If we have companions, all we
ask of them at such times is that they should
be silent. The wonders of mountain and snow,
ocean and sky, need not the explanatory or
descriptive notes of any commentator when we
have the reality before our own eyes. The man
to whose deeper nature they do not at once
appeal will not learn their secrets any the better
for listening to the ecstatic ejaculations of the
noisy friend who is for ever at his elbow telling
him how lovely are those purple mountains, or
how rich the colours of that splendid sunset. It
is better to acquire the reputation of being insensible
to all beauty than to force oneself to
listen patiently and respond cheerfully to such
well-meant chatter. The feelings that such
aspects of Nature produce within us are not
feelings that any man has ever yet learned to
put into words. Speech, after all, can only
interpret the thoughts that lie on the surface
of our natures; the deeper thoughts and the
nobler emotions elude the grasp of mere human
language. The mystic well knows, and the poet
well knows, that their sublimest visions cannot
be adequately rendered, even by the use of the
most splendid imagery and allegory, in the terms
of written or spoken language. And similarly it
is known to every lover of Nature, though he be
no poet, that the deepest mysteries of Nature's
loveliness are only revealed to him who possesses,
in the unsounded depths of his own soul, the
key that can unlock them. And what he has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
learned he can no more communicate to others
than a Saint Teresa or a Saint Ignatius can
describe in fitting words the visions that were
shown to them in their mystic trances.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LONELINESS</div>

<p>Each
of us, after all, must act as the pilot of his
own soul in its solitary voyage through the unknown.
The loneliness of the individual human
soul is one of the saddest facts of human experience,
but there are divine moments in the lives
at least of some of us when by the contemplation
of the supremely beautiful in Nature or in
Art, or by the stirring of some profound emotion,
we feel that our loneliness is a mere appearance
that will pass away: moments in which we feel
that we are in communion and fellowship with
the perfect beauty and white truth that lie beyond
the fleeting shadowland in which we daily move.
And though our splendid visions may not be
always present to fill us with rapture, we feel
that the spiritual wisdom they have given us
can at all times be drawn upon to help and
guide us through the darker hours of our lonely
daily life.</p>

<p>The Yalung river forms the western frontier of
the dominions of the king of Chala. Across the
river lies the country generally known as Huang
Lama, which is governed by its own lama-prince.
The guide whom the king had deputed to accompany
me thus far, and who had proved himself
a sturdy, honest fellow, had now to return to
Tachienlu, leaving me to the care of the three
Chinese soldiers who had been instructed to follow
me all the way to the borders of the province of
Yunnan. Before leaving me, the king's man was
obliging enough to cross the river in order to
explain to the people of the other side that I
was a harmless traveller and deserving of their
assistance. This was a necessary precaution, for
the <i>ula</i> privilege had been extended to me only
as far as the king of Chala's frontier.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">LOLOS</div>

<p>The king's brother had told me in Tachienlu
that on the banks of the Yalung I should find
a colony of "White-bone" Lolos. The Lolos&mdash;to
whom I have already referred&mdash;were once a
powerful non-Chinese race inhabiting a great part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
of southern Ssuch'uan and the greater part of
Yunnan. A large remnant of them still maintains
its independence in the mountainous country
between the Chien-ch'ang valley and the Upper
Yangtse. The so-called <i lang="zh">Hei-Ku-t'ou</i> or "Black-bones,"
are the aristocrats of the race, the <i lang="zh">Pai-Ku-t'ou</i>
or "White-bones" the "tame" ones,
who do what they are told by any one who
has authority over them, whether of their own
race or not. The Lolos are an interesting people
from the European point of view on account
of their obstinate self-reliance, their dislike for
the Chinese, and their mysterious history. The
12,000 square miles or so of mountain-land which
still belong to them comprise one of the least-known
corners of the Chinese empire;<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> but this
is only owing to the jealousy of the Chinese,
who object to Europeans going where they cannot
and dare not go themselves. A well-conducted
European able to satisfy his hosts that he had no
hostile intentions would probably be well received
in Lolo-land, for the people seem to be as hospitable
as those of Laos and the Shan States, with
whom, indeed, it is just possible that they are
ethnologically connected. The European students
of their language could be numbered on the fingers
of one hand, and no one has yet given a comprehensive
account of it. It is evident from Paul
Vial's little hand-book<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a>&mdash;which deals with some
of the Lolo tribes of Yunnan&mdash;that there are
several dialects, which probably represent several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
broad tribal cleavages. It is doubtful, indeed,
whether many of the Yunnan Lolos would be
able to carry on an intelligent conversation with
the independent Lolos of the Ta Liang Shan.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a>
During the day's holiday which I gave my men
at Pa-U-Rong&mdash;for I remained there two nights&mdash;I
made enquiries about the isolated Lolo
colonists of whom I had heard, and discovered
that the information given me was accurate. I
had great difficulty in persuading one of them
to come to me and tell me something of their
history; and the one who finally accepted the
bribe which I held out was not a brilliant specimen
of the attractive race to which he belonged.
He was afflicted with deafness, stupidity and extreme
nervousness, had no knowledge of Chinese,
and was only partially acquainted with the local
dialect of Tibetan. I managed, however, to take
down a small vocabulary from him<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> and extracted
hesitating answers to a few of my questions. In
Pa-U-Rong and its suburb villages there are some
twenty-three families of Lolos. They came from
the independent Lolo country, east of Yüeh-hsi,
about the year 1850, the migration being due to
a tribal feud. They were well received by the
local <i lang="zh">t'u pai hu</i>, and lands were allotted to them
for which they pay an annual rent. In or about
the year 1864 they addressed a petition to the
king of Chala in which they begged to be enrolled
among his subjects. The answer to this petition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
was favourable, and they have since been treated
with every kindness, for which they are grateful.
They use the Tibetan alphabet in transcribing
their language,<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> but only a few of them can
read and write. They call themselves <i lang="bo">Drü</i>, which
has the meaning of "comrades." They worship a
deity called Ba Le Nim Bu and another called San
To. The latter is supposed to reside on the top of
one of the high mountains overlooking Pa-U-Rong
on the north-east. They neither bury nor burn
their dead: they tie a white veil over the dead
man's face, swathe him in a shroud, and throw
him into the Yalung. The poorest among them
go barefooted and scarify the soles of their feet
with a hot iron in order to make them hard.
When the head of a family dies his property goes
to his eldest son; if there is no son the widow
adopts a boy, who then takes the family surname
and succeeds to the property&mdash;much as is done
in China. If there is no heir, the property goes
to the lamas, in accordance with Tibetan custom.</p>

<div class="caption">A HALT ON THE ROAD TO MULI.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">RELIGION AMONG LOLOS</div>

<p>The statement regarding the deity on the
mountain-top is interesting as showing that
when the Lolos migrate they take their gods
with them and give them a new residence in
a locality convenient for acts of worship. It
seems to be an established fact that the Lolos
have never been converted to Buddhism. Mount
Omei is to them a sacred mountain, but it is
to worship gods of their own and not Buddhas
or Bodhisattvas that they go thither on pilgrim<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>age.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a>
Considering their fondness for mountains
as religious centres, it does not seem rash to
hazard the prophecy that when their country has
been explored the highest point of the Ta Liang
Shan will be found to be the Olympus of their
gods. The little colony of emigrants has no
doubt been obliged to conform to most of the
social customs of those among whom they live,
and this is sufficient to explain why among them
the lamas are regarded as <i lang="la">ultimus haeres</i> of their
property. As time goes on it is probable that
their descendants will gradually forget their own
language and the history of their race.</p>

<p>An old man&mdash;not a Lolo&mdash;who said his
name was Shou Ji Tseri, paid me a visit in
order to tell me that he was a Roman Catholic.
He had been converted by a French missionary
in Tachienlu over twenty years before, and though
he had long since migrated to Pa-U-Rong, he
and his family had remained steadfast in the faith.
He assured me that he was not persecuted, and
suffered no social disabilities through being a
Christian.</p>

<p>The landlord of my house was the <i lang="zh">t'u pai hu</i>,<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a>
and he was evidently a devout Buddhist, or rather
lamaist. The room in which I was quartered was
a kind of private chapel, containing a small library
of Tibetan books grimy with age. More numerous
than the books were bundles of charms supposed
to ward off disease and ill-fortune. They consisted
of small stiff cards, not unlike playing-cards in size<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
and appearance, covered with writing on one side,
and crudely-painted pictures of horses and other
animals on the other.</p>

<p>On the eve of my departure from Pa-U-Rong
I gave my returning guide a letter in which I
informed the king of my safe arrival at the limits
of his territory. The lack of startling adventures
was perhaps a little disconcerting after all that I
had been told of the perils of the way, but I was
glad to know that I had not contributed to the
collapse of that amiable monarch's already rather
insecure throne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ROPE-BRIDGE</div>

<p>I made my exit from the kingdom of Chala by
the undignified expedient of sliding down a rope.
The Yalung<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a> is one of the greatest tributaries of
the Yangtse, but it is full of rapids and cascades,
and is unnavigable. At Pa-U-Rong it is about
70 or 80 yards broad, and the current is very swift
and strong. I heard that till recently it could at
the season of slack water be crossed by a raft;<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a>
but at the time of my visit there was no raft or
boat of any kind on the river (the last one had
been wrecked and lost), and a single stout cable
of twisted bamboo, stretched from bank to bank,
afforded the only means of crossing. The frontispiece
to this book, which reproduces a photograph
taken by myself, shows one of my followers in the
act of making the passage. Bridges of this kind are
common in Tibet, and in the Himālayan gorges,
but it is not often that the stream to be crossed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
is so wide as the Yalung. The main roads&mdash;such
as the highroad from Tachienlu to Lhasa&mdash;are
generally provided with good bridges or ferries;
and, as a rule, it is only when travelling by the
"small roads" and by-ways of Tibet that one is
compelled to cross rivers and gorges by single
ropes. The abbé Huc admits that in the course
of his long journey to Lhasa and back he never
ventured on bridges of this kind, though he
frequently saw them. Captain Gill<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> remarks that
"this is a method of crossing a river that must
require a considerable amount of nerve"; but he
too, apparently, evaded the necessity of putting
the matter to personal test. In my case there
was no possibility of evasion.</p>

<p>The first view of this primitive substitute for
a bridge certainly does not inspire one with confidence.
There is one rope for crossing from the
left to the right bank, and another&mdash;some 30 yards
off&mdash;for the reverse proceeding. The banks on
either side are high and steep, and each rope-end
is firmly bound round an immovable rock
or boulder. The arrangement is shown in the
accompanying diagram.</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
<img src="images/i_240.jpg"  alt="Diagram of rope bridge" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">CROSSING THE YALUNG</div>

<p>On crossing from the left bank (Pa-U-Rong
side) one starts at the point A, reaching the right
bank at the point B. Crossing in the opposite
direction one starts at C, reaching the left bank at
D. The points A and C are about 120 feet above
the level of the water. B and D are about 40 feet
lower. The native of the district, when about to
cross the river, places a semicircular piece of tough
wood, with two grooves for the fingers, on the
bamboo rope, clutches it with both hands and
lets himself go. He is not tied to the movable
cylinder or to the rope, and he has nothing to sit
on. He simply holds on with his hands, his legs
hanging in the air. He descends with terrific
speed to the point where the rope sags or hangs
lowest (the points E and F); and having safely
arrived there, he is only a few yards from the
further bank, and quickly hauls himself along the
remaining distance. In this manner the crossing
is only a matter of a few exhilarating seconds.
With us, however, the operation was a longer one.
Unfortunately, the proper rope for leaving the
left bank was old, and had been condemned
as unsafe; all my party, therefore, were obliged
to use the rope that was only intended for crossing
in the opposite direction. The rope-end
at the point C, however, had been temporarily
brought down to the point G, as it would otherwise
have been necessary for us to haul ourselves
along nearly the whole length of the rope in an
ascending direction, which would have been a task
requiring great strength and endurance. Even as
it was, instead of a rapid rush through the air<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
across almost the whole width of the river, the
weight of our bodies only took us about two-thirds
of the total distance, and from that point we had
to proceed by throwing our legs over the rope and
pulling ourselves upwards inch by inch, hand over
hand. The work was exceedingly laborious. All
my party went across in this manner one by one,
starting at D and arriving at G. The point H
represents the place at which we had to commence
hauling. In view of the fact that we were all
novices at rope-climbing, each of us submitted,
before starting, to having a leather thong tied
under the arms, and made fast to the sliding
cylinder, so that if loss of nerve or other cause
had made us let go we should not have fallen into
the river, but hung limply on the rope until
rescued. There was, therefore, no actual danger
provided that nothing gave way. In some places
where these primitive bridges are in use, passengers
are provided with a swinging rope-seat which
hangs from the cylinder. This, of course, must
relieve the strain on hands and arms very considerably.
But we were furnished with no such luxury.
My dog Jim was sent across by himself, his body
being firmly tied up with strips of cloth suspended
from the cylinder, from which the unhappy beast
hung like a squirming fish at the end of a line.
When he reached the point at which upward
hauling became necessary, one of the natives&mdash;who
seemed to delight in performing acrobatic
feats above the swirling waters of the Yalung&mdash;clambered
along from the right bank with an extra
rope and tied it round him. He did this while he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
was hanging upside down with his legs round the
rope-bridge. The loose end of the spare rope he
took back with him to the right bank, and the dog
was safely pulled by several willing hands along the
remaining distance. My baggage was sent across
in the same manner. I found the experience
interesting and somewhat exciting. The whole
village turned out to watch us cross the river,
and I must confess that when I was being trussed
up with the leather thong my feelings were perhaps
only comparable to those of a condemned criminal
who is being pinioned before execution. A fall
into the river would mean almost certain death.
The water seethes and bubbles in innumerable
whirlpools, and is nearly as cold as ice, for it
largely consists of frozen snow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">YALUNG RIVER</div>

<p>I never heard the Yalung given that name
by the natives. The word is a Chinese approximation
to the Tibetan Nya Rong ("Valley of the
Nya"). The Tibetans all know the river as the
Nya Ch'u or Nya river; but the Chinese, so far
as my experience goes, never give it any other
name than <i lang="zh">Kin</i> [<i lang="zh">Chin</i>] Ho, which means "Gold
River,"&mdash;so that "Yalung" is really only a book-word.
The number of rivers in western China, of
which the word "Gold" forms part of the Chinese
name, might almost fill a page. The Ta Tu river
above Wa Ssu Kou<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> is the Chin Ch'uan ("Gold
Stream"), the Yangtse for hundreds of miles of its
course is the Chin Sha Chiang [Kin Sha Kiang],
or "River of Golden Sand," and many streams of
less importance bear similar names. The reason<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
of the popularity of the name is not far to seek,
for gold in larger or smaller quantities is well
known to exist in nearly all the rivers that take
their rise in eastern and northern Tibet, and the
Tibetans&mdash;especially the lamas&mdash;derive therefrom
a very considerable profit.</p>

<p>Baber pointed out that the upper Yangtse,
from its junction with the Yalung to about P'ing-shan
(above the mouth of the Min), is "never
called locally by any other name than <i lang="zh">Kin-</i>[<i lang="zh">Chin-</i>]
<i lang="zh">Ho</i>, or 'Gold River.'" M. Cordier, in quoting
this passage in his sumptuous edition of Marco
Polo's travels,<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> says that he imagines Baber to have
made a slight mistake in saying that this part of
the great river is named a <i lang="zh">ho</i>, and that the word
actually used is probably <i lang="zh">kiang</i>. As both words
mean "river" the point is of small importance, but
as a matter of fact Baber is perfectly right. Not
only is the Yangtse from the mouth of the Min
to the mouth of the Yalung called the Kin [Chin]
Ho, as Baber said, but it seems obvious that the
natives regard the Yalung as the main upper
stream of the same river, just as they regard the
Min as the main upper stream of the Yangtse
hundreds of miles lower down.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> Baber was no
doubt unaware that the Yalung was known as
the Kin Ho, or he would have seen why it is
that its junction with what we know as the
Yangtse effects a change in the name of the latter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RIGHT BANK OF YALUNG</div>

<p>In official publications, however, the local
names are disregarded. In such works the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
Yangtse is given one name from its entrance into
Ssuch'uan down to Hsü-chou-fu, where it comes
to an untimely end by entering the Min:<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> and
that one name is the Chin Sha Chiang.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> As
regards its Tibetan course, the Chinese geographical
authorities attempt after their usual cumbrous
fashion to give the sounds of the various Tibetan
names&mdash;they write of the <i lang="bo">Mu-lu-ssŭ-wu-su</i> for
instance&mdash;but they recognise it as the same river.
In explanation of the local idea that the Yalung
is the principal stream it may be mentioned that
at the point of junction the Yalung has the
appearance of being larger than the Yangtse.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a></p>

<p>We did not proceed far on our journey during
the day on which we accomplished the feat of
crossing the Yalung. We clambered up the steep
slope to a height of about 1,500 feet and remained
for the night in the poor hamlet of Dju Mu. We
were still well within sight of Pa-U-Rong, having
travelled only about 12 <i lang="zh">li</i>. A change of language
or dialect perplexed my servant as soon as we
had crossed the river, and though it is rash to
generalise from the appearance of the inhabitants
of a few isolated villages, there seemed to be racial
changes as well. The Tibetan-Man-tzŭ population
of the kingdom of Chala seems to give place to a
race-group which might be described as Tibetan-Mo-so.
The men are shorter than those of
the eastern watershed of the Yalung, the women<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
plainer and stouter and of heavier build. There is
no great change in the dress of the men, but the
women&mdash;perhaps recognising their deficiency of
personal attractiveness&mdash;show an exaggerated fondness
for jewellery and trinkets, which make a
ceaseless jingle as they walk.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHARMS AND AMULETS</div>

<p>Many of the people&mdash;men
as well as women&mdash;wear large earrings
consisting of plain circles of silver, from which,
in the case of girls, are suspended long strings
of coloured beads. On both sides of the Yalung&mdash;but
not far from its banks on either side&mdash;the
women also wear curious silver plates or plaques
which are fastened to their hair. Unmarried girls
wear one and married women two of these ornaments.
Some of the plaques&mdash;which vary in
size from about 5 inches to more than a foot in
diameter&mdash;are adorned with dainty filigree work,
which would do credit to the silversmiths of any
country, but the majority are simple and of rude
workmanship, such as the specimen which with
difficulty I succeeded in purchasing.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> In the
middle of each plaque is a silver tube containing
some red substance that from a distance looks like
dark coral. These little plates are regarded as
ornaments, but they are also charms to ward off
a certain dread disease. From a description of
the ailment it would appear to be something like
bubonic plague. I saw no cases of it, but I was
told that it devastates the valley of the Yalung
every autumn, and kills every one who does not
wear a charm. It is curious to note that nearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
all the great trough-like river-valleys of south-western
China have acquired a similar reputation
of extreme unhealthiness. The Red River of
Tongking and Yunnan is so much dreaded by the
Chinese on account of its deadly fevers that
nothing will induce them to spend a night on its
banks.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> The Salwen, the valley of which forms
a yawning chasm from north to south of the
Yunnan plateau, has an even worse reputation, as
is well known to all who have travelled from Talifu
to Bhamo.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a> Charms against disease are worn
by the men of the Yalung valley as well as by the
women, but they do not take the same form. The
men and boys carry a small charm-box (<i lang="bo">ga-u</i><a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a>)
hung round their necks like a locket by a string
or chain, and in the box they place little amulets<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a>
which they have received from the lamas. The
efficacy of the charms is supposed to be impaired
if they are removed from the person or put into
the hands of a stranger, so it is not often that one
has an opportunity of close examination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">YAK AND BUFFALO</div>

<p>The next day (28th April) we travelled a very
short distance&mdash;about 6 miles. The path wound
round the edge of a defile and up the mountain
side west and south-west through a pine forest.
We halted at a place called Tê Ben, a single
house belonging to a headman, situated near the
edge of a bluff that commanded a fine view of
the Yalung valley, now far below us. Difficulties
about transport prevented our making a longer
stage. Next day, these difficulties having been
overcome, our path led us over innumerable
undulations, in the course of which we gradually
ascended another 2,000 feet. At the hamlet of Pa
Sung, which we reached during the morning, there
were no animals to be hired, and our baggage was
carried for the rest of the day's march by three
women and a yak. One of my Chinese escort&mdash;not
in love with his mountaineering experiences&mdash;was
much perturbed at the discovery that
he was expected to walk, and made himself so
disagreeable to the villagers that they had to
bribe him to calmness by making him a present
of a live fowl. He accepted the fowl, and made
one of the village damsels carry it for him. This
incident was not discovered by me until our arrival
at our destination that night, when I punished
my soldier for the impropriety of his conduct by
paying for the fowl and eating it myself. The
yak caused us some trouble by losing itself in
the forest while we were having our midday
<i lang="bo">tsamba</i>. It was finally discovered by its driver&mdash;a
very little boy&mdash;and brought back by him
triumphantly at the end of a rope. The incident<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
pleasantly recalled to my memory the only poem
in the English language, so far as I am aware,
which sings the exclusive praises of the yak, an
animal which, however useful to man, is indeed
hardly of the kind that would naturally inspire a
poet to a lyrical outburst.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> Tibetan and Man-tzŭ
children seem to be able to manage the clumsy
beast with the same ease and dexterity as are
shown by Chinese children in controlling the
cumbrous movements of the water-buffalo; and
the European who may prod a yak without the
least effect in accelerating its motion, and whose
mere proximity often rouses the water-buffalo to
dangerous fury, can have nothing but jealous
admiration for the Oriental child whose lightest
touch reduces one or the other to complete
docility.</p>

<p>From the hamlet of Pa Sung we dropped down
to a deep ravine at the bottom of which is a
sparkling mountain stream spanned by a rustic
bridge. The ravine was full of wild-flowers&mdash;pink,
red, purple and white in a setting of rich green.
I noticed also that ivy&mdash;not so common a sight
in the Far East as in England&mdash;clambered in great
profusion round the trunks of trees and over a
small obo; and some exquisite ferns, including
maiden-hair, covered the steep banks of the stream
and fringed our path. After climbing up the
further side of the ravine our path again wound
up and along the mountain-side, and brought us
finally to the hamlet of Ten Ba K'a, where we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
lodged in the local chiefs house. Our host was
a fine-looking man, whose long black hair hanging
down on each side of his face gave him
an appearance of ferocity that was belied by the
gentleness of his manners. I was accommodated
in the family chapel&mdash;a large room on the first
floor. Close by was a small lamasery. The
village is situated at the head of a small valley
which runs north-east and south-west, and from
it we had a magnificent view of the snowy
mountains we had left behind us on the other
side of the Yalung. The valley itself&mdash;when one
looks down upon it from above&mdash;is of very peculiar
formation, being split up by a series of clearly-defined
ridges. I could see nothing to indicate
that they were glacier moraines. Next morning
we climbed one of the ridges that lies immediately
behind the village, and from its summit we
descended into a thickly-wooded ravine, bounded
on the left by lofty and picturesque cliffs. After
descending a thousand feet or more we emerged
from the ravine into a small partially-cultivated
valley containing a village. After leaving this
village, where we took our midday rest, we began
a long and rather wearisome up-hill climb past a
plantation of birches and through a thin forest.
From the top of the pass we made a gradual
descent through similar country, and struck into the
valley of a large stream&mdash;the Dja Ch'u&mdash;issuing,
apparently, from some high snowy peaks visible
in the distance.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> This river accompanied us from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
this point practically all the way to Muli. Our
path led us hundreds of feet above the river's
left bank, and brought us to our night's lodging
in a solitary house. Other scattered houses were
visible some distance off, and I was told that they
all bear the collective name of Hu Dra. Our
hostess brought me as a present the best Tibetan
cheese I had tasted.</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="MOUNTAIN_AND_VALLEY"></a>

<div class="caption"> MOUNTAIN AND VALLEY ON THE ROAD TO MULI</div>
</div>


<div class="sidenote">A QUARREL</div>

<p>The next day, 1st May, we left our quarters
at Hu Dra just as the sun rose, on a beautiful
fresh morning that reminded one almost too
vividly of early summer in England. Even the
cuckoo was not wanting. The road led us at first
in a south-easterly direction high above the left
bank of the Dja Ch'u for about 3 miles, then
turned with that river into a valley running south-west.
A mile or so beyond the bend I observed
a village on the right bank, but we kept to the
left, still high above the river. Nearly opposite
that village we came to a couple of tumbledown
huts. While we were resting here, two of my
soldiers took the opportunity to disgrace May Day
by indulging in a violent quarrel. For the sake
of cacophony I had previously given one of these
men the unmelodious name of Bloggins, owing to
the singular irregularity of his features. Certainly
no one could have mistaken him for a reincarnation
of Plato's Charmides. To the other,
for a different reason, I had given the surname
of Hoggins. Before I could learn the cause of
the dispute and settle it by friendly arbitration,
Hoggins drew his sword and began laying it
about him in a manner suggestive of slaughter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
and blood. The effects were not serious, as the
blade of the sword, not being intended for actual
warfare, broke off at the hilt. Bloggins took
shelter behind a mule. The quarrel arose and
subsided like a thunderstorm, for in half an hour
the combatants were again on the most amiable
terms with each other and drowning the memory
of their disagreement in a bowl of tea.</p>

<p>From the scene of this bloodless combat the
road continued to lead us high above the left bank
of the river-valley, giving us occasional glimpses
of the many windings of the stream. One has to
ride with caution, as the path frequently lies along
the edge of a precipice. The surface is sometimes
very rough and rocky, and the road undulates a
great deal as it has to cross a number of deep
ravines. After riding about 65 <i lang="zh">li</i> from our starting-place
we reached the neighbourhood of an
important lamasery, named Wa-chin Gompa,<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a> well
hidden in a wooded dell. The lamas objected to
receiving us here, so we went on to a scattered
hamlet called Ta K'oa. The Dja Ch'u here
changes its name to the Ya-Rong Ch'u.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WILD-FLOWERS</div>

<p>A great authority has told us that among
the losses brought upon us by the fury and
vulgarity of modern life, one of the saddest is the
loss of a wish to gather a flower in travelling.<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a>
Perhaps it was because I was so far from the
beaten tracks of civilisation that on that beautiful
May morning the wish to gather flowers still
asserted in me its vigorous vitality. The wild-flowers
during that day's journey were indeed so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
numerous and beautiful that all the members of
my party yielded to the temptation of decking
themselves out in blossoms pink and white and
blue. The dainty freshness of our summer garlands
only served, I fear, to throw into stronger
relief the dirt and dust of our travel-stained
garments. Though there were three flower-bedecked
women among my party, I was moved
by no impulse to crown any one of the three
as our Queen of May. It would be ungallant to
give the reasons. But if none of them was
conspicuous for beauty of figure or feature, I
think it only fair to call to grateful remembrance
the fact that one was the possessor of an alluring
smile and a not unattractive dimple.</p>

<p>On 2nd May a pretty road lined with
"English" hedgerows bursting into bloom, led
us after a ride of 4 miles to a point from which
we obtained a fine view of the river&mdash;a long
stretch of smooth water shining in the sun, a
rather violent rapid, and a series of graceful curves.
From the village of Dje Ru we descended for
the first time to the river-bank and crossed the
stream&mdash;now called the Tong Yi&mdash;by a substantial
wooden bridge about 50 yards long. I have
already referred to the variety of names possessed
by the rivers of this region. The stream which
we knew first on 30th April as the Dja Ch'u had
changed its name at least seven times before we
finally left its banks three days later; but as in
the case of many other Tibetan rivers, the different
names often represent merely the tribal names of
the various village communities that dwell on its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
banks, or even the names of the valleys through
which it flows. In the interests of geography it
would no doubt be more satisfactory if every river
were given one name only, by which it could be
universally known throughout the whole length
of its course; but the convenience of so doing
would hardly appeal to people who never saw a
map, and never travel, and know nothing of their
rivers except the short stretches that flow by
their doors. I did not meet a single inhabitant
of the Yalung watershed who was able to tell
me whence any of their rivers came, or whither
it went. Such questions seemed to them merely
frivolous, the answers being regarded as beyond
the range of possible human knowledge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VALLEY OF LITANG RIVER</div>

<p>About a mile beyond the wooden bridge the
river becomes the Wo Pu Tsong, and later on
the Mi Ch'u. Not far beyond, a fairly large
tributary&mdash;the Ba Tsam Ch'u&mdash;enters by a valley
in the east, and joins the main stream at a point
where, after flowing for some miles due south,
it turns sharply to the south-west. Our path,
following the right bank of the river, now turned
into a narrow valley through which we travelled
for the rest of the stage, and from which we did
not emerge till the middle of the following day.
This valley possesses, perhaps, the most beautiful
riverine scenery met with anywhere throughout
my journey, though it is not on the same grand
scale as the scenery of the Yangtse gorges or
the valley of the Ta Tu. After travelling along
an undulating road for about 5 miles, we came
to a place which possesses the abrupt name of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
Wu, where&mdash;on the flat roof of one of the two
huts forming the hamlet&mdash;we had our midday
meal. Just before reaching this spot we passed
a place where two landslips, one on each side
of the river, had very recently taken place. Part
of the subsiding banks having fallen into the
water, a violent rapid had been formed across
the river.</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="Recess_with_miniature_Buddha"></a>
<img src="images/i_207.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">A&mdash;Recess with miniature Buddha, on the S.E. side.<br />
B&mdash;Conventional lions in relief, two on each of the four sides.</div>
</div>

<p>In this extremely beautiful valley the river is
known as the Li Ch'u. It is an unnavigable stream
containing a considerable body of water sometimes
nearly 100 yards broad, but occasionally
narrowed to 30. An easy walk through the most
charming sylvan scenery brought us, a few miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
beyond Wu, to a wooded glade, where&mdash;as the
moon had already risen and there was no sign
of a village&mdash;I decided to camp out. There is
here an obo covered with the usual inscribed
slates; and close by stands a square stone building
with a wooden roof. This building serves as a
kind of canopy for a <i lang="zh">ch'o-ten</i><a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a> (ch'orten), or small
lamaist pyramid, which occupies the whole space
inside. My sketch of this ch'orten, which is of
a type very common in Tibetan lands, will convey
an idea of its appearance.</p>

<p>The stone canopy&mdash;a plain, unpretentious
building<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a>&mdash;faces the south-east. It has four doorways,
one on each side. The ch'orten itself is of
stone, covered with plaster, and whitewashed, and
stands about 20 feet high.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TIBETAN CH'ORTEN</div>

<p>Rockhill, describing similar structures met
with elsewhere, remarks that the word "ch'orten"
means "offering-holder." "Great numbers" he
says "are built in the vicinity of lamaseries, and
serve to point out the roads leading to them.
They are also something like the stations in the
Catholic 'Path of the Cross,' as pilgrims, when
journeying to a shrine, perform prostrations before
each ch'orten met on the way thither."<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> Colonel
Waddell has an interesting note to explain the
symbolical character of this type of building.
He says that ch'ortens are "symbolic of the five
elements into which a body is resolved upon
death: thus ... the lowest section, a solid rect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>angular
block, typifies the solidity of the <i>earth</i>;
above it <i>water</i> is represented by a globe; <i>fire</i>
by a triangular tongue; <i>air</i> by a crescent&mdash;the
inverted vault of the sky; and <i>ether</i> by an
acuminated circle, the tapering into space."<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a>
The Tibetan ch'ortens may thus be regarded
either as the tombstones of dead lamas or as
chambers for preserving the relics of Buddhist
saints. In the latter case they are analogous
to the far more imposing pagodas of China or
the dagobas of Burma and of Anuradhapura in
Ceylon.</p>

<p>Outside the stone building containing the
ch'orten I spent the night of 2nd May. We
were now in a sheltered ravine and in a fairly
warm latitude. We were therefore independent
of walled shelter, and, as we carried with us our
own <i lang="bo">tsamba</i>, we were in no want of food. The
spot we had chosen was indeed an ideal resting-place.
The utter peacefulness of our beautiful
valley, the murmur of the stream only a few yards
away, the soft shimmer of moonlight interwoven
with the network of fresh foliage that curtained
mysterious fairylands beyond, combined to create
an earthly paradise that might almost make one
cease to long for a heavenly one. If Shakespeare
had visited the Far East, he would surely have
chosen just such a spot as this for the scene of
a new Midsummer Night's Dream. It was sad
to reflect that until æroplanes come into general
use it could never be made accessible to lovers
of nature except those who were willing to cross<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
the vast ranges of snowy mountains that hem it
in; but I could not restrain a feeling of exultation
at the thought that never&mdash;I hope this is
no rash prophecy&mdash;would the shriek of a steam-engine
disturb here</p>

<p>and that our boisterous civilisation would be
content to leave this one nook of beauty for
ever undefiled. If any of my readers is yearning
to seek in some quiet hermitage rest and release
from the pains and feverish joys of modern life,
some home of ancient peace amid lovely scenery,
let him turn his pilgrim steps towards the far lands
of the Tibetan border, for his ideal would be surely
realised in some such valley as this.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARRIVAL AT MULI</div>

<p>It was with regret, not shared, I fear, by my
unemotional companions, that I left my camping-ground
on the morning of the next day. For
half the day, however, our path still lay through
the southern portion of the same beautiful valley,
and amid scenery no less charming than that
of the day before. A short distance beyond our
camp a turn in the path brought us opposite to
a ravine opening towards the east, on the river's
left bank. The sun rose behind it as I passed,
and shed a rich glow on rocks and cascades and
masses of pure green foliage. A walk of 5 or
6 miles brought us to a crazy wooden bridge<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a>
over which we crossed with some trepidation
to the left bank, and about 3 miles further<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
on we again crossed to the right. Beyond this
the scenery becomes wilder, and the river-valley
gradually opens out into a region where rocks
and hills lie about in fantastic confusion. Passing
oboes, prayer-flags and prayer-wheels in great
numbers, we climbed up a steep and winding
path that gradually led us far away from the
Li Ch'u and brought us to a scattered mountain
village named Ku-Dze, where we rested. One
of my men had gone in advance of us in order
to arrange for new means of transport; and when
I arrived at the village I found that the hospitable
headman had converted four tumbledown, roofless
walls into a delightful arbour with a thick, soft
carpet of green leaves and walls of pine-branches,
and a doorway festooned with feathery bamboo.
In this Arcadian retreat I was provided with an
appropriate repast of milk and eggs.</p>

<p>From this village to the lamasery of Muli&mdash;the
capital, if it may be called so, of the Huang
Lama territory&mdash;is a distance of about 14 miles
through pleasant undulating country and over an
easy road. At one point, however, we found
the main path blocked by a huge landslip,
and for a distance of several miles we were
obliged to take a rough and rocky path that
gave us a good deal of trouble. We did not
arrive at Muli till after sunset. There is nothing
to show that one is anywhere near a human
habitation until suddenly, after turning a corner,
one comes in full view of a mass of white walls
only a few hundred yards away. This is the
lamasery of Muli. To all appearance it is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
compact, unwalled town composed entirely of
white-plastered houses. In reality it is a large
monastery and nothing else, for all the buildings
that look like ordinary houses are only the separate
cells or dwelling-places of the lamas. Two or
three of them, in their dark-red gowns, were
waiting to receive me. These were the people
who, I had been led to understand, were fanatically
anti-foreign, and whose hostility rendered
it a dangerous experiment to travel through their
country. If their feelings were of a hostile nature,
they certainly evinced a wonderful power of self-control,
for their reception of me was altogether
courteous and friendly. They lodged me in a
comfortable two-floored building only a few yards
from the lamasery, and sent me presents of fuel
and food.</p>

<p class="center">MULI TO YUNG-NING</p>


<p>The territory ruled over by the lama-prince of
Muli<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> is to Europeans, as it is to the Chinese
themselves, almost an unknown corner of the
Chinese empire. One may search in vain through
books of history or travel for any description of
it. Even the <i lang="zh">Ssuch'uan T'ung Chih</i>&mdash;a work
that describes the province in nearly two hundred
volumes&mdash;devotes to it only a single page. Baber
does little more than refer to it by name. He
describes it as "a country of which almost nothing
is known, lying south of Litang and west of the
Yalung. I can only learn," he adds, "that the
language of its inhabitants is unintelligible to
Tibetans. The Chinese call it the 'land of the
Yellow Lamas.' The Mili of D'Anville's map is
probably its chief monastery."<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> Hosie, in his
recent report of a journey through Litang and
Batang to the border of Tibet proper, refers to it
as "the State of Mili, or Muli&mdash;better known as
Huang Lama ('Yellow Lama')." As regards this
name "Huang Lama," there appears to be some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
confusion of ideas, either on the part of the
natives of the state or on the part of the Chinese.
<i lang="zh">Huang</i> means "yellow," but another word of
identical sound though differently written means
"imperial,"<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> and I was assured by the lamas themselves&mdash;who
may have been deliberately misleading
me&mdash;that the <i lang="zh">huang</i> which is applied to their
territory or its rulers is the second of these.
According to this theory, the state of Muli is
the land of the Imperial Lamas (or Lama), not
the land of the "Yellow Lamas." The Muli
lamas do, however, belong to one of the Gélupa
or reformed sects, and therefore wear the "yellow
hat" in religious ceremonials.</p>

<div class="sidenote">KING OF MULI</div>

<p>Unfortunately, the lama-prince was not at
Muli at the time of my arrival there, and three
or four subordinate lamas, who called upon me
and with whom I conversed in Tibetan with the
assistance of my servant, were either disinclined
or unable to impart much information. But as
far as I could gather, it appears that "a long time
ago"<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a> the principal lama of this country rendered
valuable services to the Chinese Emperor, and
received as a reward the title of "Huang Lama,"
and was confirmed in the spiritual and temporal
sovereignty of the whole principality of Muli. It is
evident, however, that Muli has for centuries past
been regarded as a debatable land: sometimes
the kings or Grand Lamas of Tibet and sometimes
the emperors of China have been regarded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
as suzerains. According to one story which was
told me by a lama, Muli-land was at one time an
integral part of the "monarchy" of Tachienlu,
and was ceded to a certain lama by one of the
kings of Chala as a reward for having cured the
king of a painful disease. However this may
be, the dignity of prince-lama is now, and long
has been, the exclusive monopoly of one family.
The system of succession is therefore totally
different from that generally in vogue in Tibet
proper, where the prior of a lamasery is either
selected by the Dalai Lama or by the whole
body of lamas, or&mdash;in the case of the greater
establishments&mdash;is chosen as an infant to fill
that high office because he is believed to be the
reincarnation of the prior or abbot last deceased.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a>
The ecclesiastical title of the lama-prince of Muli
is <i lang="bo">k'an-po</i>,<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> a word which may be translated lord-abbot
or bishop&mdash;and it is by that title that he is
familiarly known in his own territory; but in
virtue of his civil powers he is also a <i lang="bo">gyal-po</i> or
"king," and is just as powerful within his own
limits as the king of Chala. The Muli <i lang="bo">gyal-po</i>
being a lama cannot marry, but when he dies his
successor is chosen from among his brothers or
nephews. If an otherwise eligible heir is under
the age of eighteen or thereabouts, he is passed
over in favour of any suitable elder relative who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
may be a lama. Notification of the death of
the <i lang="bo">k'an-po</i> or <i lang="bo">gyal-po</i> must be sent to the
emperor at Peking, and at the same time the
name of a suitable heir, selected from the eligible
members of the "royal" family, is submitted for
the imperial consideration. His succession is as
a matter of form ratified by the emperor, and he
forthwith enters upon his duties and honours.
News of the <i lang="bo">k'an-po's</i> death and the accession of
his heir is also sent to Lhasa, but the approval of
the Dalai Lama is not now essential to legalise the
succession. Subject to the suzerainty of China
the <i lang="bo">k'an-po</i> is invested with full ecclesiastical and
civil powers in virtue of his double position,
but in practice he generally confines himself to
civil and judicial administration, and leaves the
management of ecclesiastical affairs to lamas of
lower rank. He has three centres of government,
all of which are also lamaseries: their names are
Muli, Lha-k'ang<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> and Khon.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a> Muli, the chief
lamasery and headquarters of the government,
contains about four hundred and fifty lamas; Lha-k'ang
and Khon between one and two hundred
each. At these centres the <i lang="bo">k'an-po</i> resides alternately,
generally remaining a year at each. I was
told that this custom was originated in order that
the <i lang="bo">k'an-po</i> might acquire a thorough knowledge
of the different parts of his territory, and that his
ear should always be open to receive his people's complaints.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">OFFICIALS OF MULI</div>

<p>Important lawsuits are decided by
the <i lang="bo">k'an-po</i> himself, but smaller suits and petty
criminal cases are dealt with by officials of lower
rank. The government is emphatically a hierarchy,
for every official&mdash;executive and judicial&mdash;is a
lama. The only apparent exceptions to this rule
are the <i lang="bo">Bei-ze</i>, village headmen, who, however,
hold no official rank, and are merely the patriarchs
or most substantial landholders of the different
villages. The <i lang="bo">bei-ze</i> is empowered to settle simple
local disputes, but he has no prestige outside his
own village. His rank is inferior to that of any
one who has donned the robe of a lama or
novitiate (<i lang="bo">tra-pa</i>). The highest officials after the
<i lang="bo">k'an-po</i> are the <i lang="bo">ch'an-dzö</i>,<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> a kind of lord high
treasurer, the <i lang="bo">ku-ts'ab</i><a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> or "commissioner," and
finally the <i lang="bo">nyer-ba</i>, whose chief duties appear to
be connected with the food-supply. All these
dignitaries are appointed by the <i lang="bo">k'an-po</i>, and hold
office during his good pleasure.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a></p>

<p>In matters affecting Chinese interests the
<i lang="bo">k'an-po</i> is expected to communicate with the
district magistrate of Yen-yüan, the prefect of
Ning-yüan, or the taotai of Ya-chou. If one of
the parties to a lawsuit is an independent Chinese,
the case is sent to the Yen-yüan magistrate, who
deals with it according to ordinary Chinese procedure,
or passes it to his superiors. But such
cases hardly ever arise in practice, as the only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
people in Muli-land who call themselves Chinese
are a few half-castes who as dependents of one
of the Huang Lama lamaseries are subject to
the <i lang="bo">k'an-po's</i> jurisdiction. The <i lang="bo">k'an-po</i> himself
is expected to proceed at least once in twelve
years to Wu T'ai Shan,<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> the sacred mountain of
Shansi, whence, after the performance of certain
religious duties, he is supposed to go to Peking
to do homage to the emperor. His presents to
the Court on such occasions take the form of gold
and skins. Within his territory he has complete
control of finances, but he pays a small annual
tribute to China. All local revenue is said to be
paid in kind, and, as in China, mainly consists in
a land-tax assessed according to the productive
capacity of the land. In addition to ordinary
taxation the people whose holdings adjoin the
main roads are subject to the same system of
<i>ula</i> that presses so hardly on many of the subjects
of the king of Chala. The <i lang="bo">k'an-po</i> also derives
considerable revenue from the gold-workings in
his territory. Gold-washing and mining rights
are vested in the lamas, who exercise a jealous
control over the output of the metal and exact
large royalties. The gold is generally disposed
of in the markets of Litang and Tachienlu. The
only remaining tax of importance is levied on
tea, which in the Muli territory is very expensive
and beyond the means of many of the inhabitants.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MULI LAMASERY</div>

<p>The present <i lang="bo">k'an-po</i> (whom, owing to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
absence at Khon, I did not meet) was in May
1906 a man of about thirty-seven years of age,
and had presided over his little state for about
seventeen years. He succeeded his elder brother.
His full designation as given to me was Ha-ba-de-li-gyal-po.<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a>
The permanent rank of the <i lang="bo">k'an-po</i> in
his capacity of Barbarian Chieftain is that of an
<i lang="bo">An Fu Ssŭ</i>.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> His territory is said to be larger
than that of the king of Chala, but it is poorer
and has a smaller population.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a></p>

<p>Within the Muli lamasery the rules of the
reformed sects of Lamaism are observed with fair
strictness, and no woman is allowed under any
pretence to enter its coenobitical precincts. This
is very different from the lax state of affairs that
prevails in the large lamaseries at Tachienlu and
further west. The houses or cells are for the most
part buildings of two stories. In spite of their
clean whitewashed exteriors they have a somewhat
forbidding aspect, as, like all Tibetan buildings,
the windows are small and have neither glass nor
paper. Boarded windows are apt to give an impression
of desolation to which it takes a long time
to become accustomed. The lamasery is built
on the slope of a mountain on which the various
buildings rise above one another tier upon tier.
The first view of it is very striking, for the configuration
of the hill conceals it from sight until
one is within a very short distance of its walls, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
then almost every separate building becomes simultaneously
visible.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> To a traveller approaching from
the south-west the view is even more remarkable;
for the whole mass of buildings is entirely hidden
from sight until he is within a stone's throw of its
nearest walls, and then it appears suddenly to rise
out of the ground before him in a blaze of whiteness.
Nearly all the buildings face east and north-east,
with their backs to the mountain. In front
of the lamasery there is a gentle slope down to a
valley running north-east and south-west, through
which flows a small stream, the Rong Ch'u or
"Valley Water." This stream flows to swell the
waters of the Li Ch'u, which is visible from Muli
at a distance of about 3 miles, and which flows
in a south-easterly direction to join the Yalung.
On the slope in front of the lamasery are terraced
fields of wheat, barley and buckwheat, and pasture-lands
for goats and yak. Behind and above the
lamasery is a forest, consisting mostly of oak-trees
and coniferæ. It is full of pheasants, but, as shooting
is prohibited in the vicinity of the lamasery,
they are of no use to a hungry sportsman. Above
the forest is a precipitous range of crags. On
the south side of the valley are sparsely-wooded
hills. Two buildings in the lamasery stand out
conspicuously, one above and the other below the
lamas' dwellings.</p>

<div class="caption">LAMASERY OF MULI.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">LAMAISM AT MULI</div>

<p>The lower one, with not very conspicuous
gilded pinnacles, may be regarded as the
cathedral, for it is there that the ordinary services
taken from the Kah-gyur and Tang-gyur&mdash;the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
scriptures of Lamaism&mdash;are daily celebrated. I
attended one of the services in the company of
two of my lama hosts, but was requested not to
go beyond the threshold of the open door. A large
choir of lamas and acolytes were on their knees,
intoning the usual chants in a manner that would
not discredit the choirs of some English churches.
The singers had evidently been well and skilfully
trained, and though the music had none of the
magnificent harmonies of European music, it was
by no means unpleasant to the ear, and once or
twice I was vaguely reminded of Palestrina. As
the interior of the building was shrouded in deep
gloom, I asked if I might enter and look round
when the service was over, but was told that
it would continue without intermission for eleven
days and nights, during which time different choirs
of lamas would successively relieve each other.
This surprising assertion was probably merely
designed to prevent my unsanctified feet from
desecrating the sacred floor; or perhaps my hosts,
who may have been told that Europeans were
noted for their predatory instincts, feared that I
might take advantage of the darkness to purloin
some of the sacred utensils. The other conspicuous
building to which I have referred stands on an
elevation overlooking the rest of the lamasery, and
was closed up when I arrived at Muli. It is the
residence of the <i lang="bo">k'an-po</i>, and in it special services
are held during one month in each year, from the
middle of the fourth to the middle of the fifth
Chinese "moon," roughly corresponding to July.
During that month no animal may be slaughtered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
and the lamas are restricted to a purely vegetable
diet. This is the only time that the Buddhist
injunction to destroy no living animal is observed
at Muli. Smoking, however, which is nowhere
referred to, so far as I remember, in the Buddhist
scriptures, is at all times strictly prohibited.</p>

<p>Muli is much smaller than some of the huge
lamaist establishments in other Tibetan states,
where there are sometimes as many lamas collected
in one lamasery as there are undergraduates at
Oxford. Muli has only four hundred and fifty, and
this number includes the <i lang="bo">tra-pa</i><a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> or novices, who are
not, strictly speaking, entitled to be called lamas.
Most of the lamas have been to Lhasa, and all
must go there on pilgrimage before they can be
allowed to hold high office. One of my hosts
informed me that the journey to Lhasa occupied
three months, but that the difficulties of the road
were less serious than those which I had myself
met with during my journey from Tachienlu.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RACE-TYPES OF MULI</div>

<p>Tibetan is the official language of the state,
and most of the lamas can speak it; but they
have also a language of their own, of which I
attempted to compile a small vocabulary.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> It
certainly appears to be allied to Tibetan, but
would be unintelligible to any one acquainted
with that language only. It seems to show a
considerable admixture of Mo-so, and perhaps of
other less-known tribal dialects. The Tibetan
alphabet is used for the transcription of sounds.
When I asked what different races inhabited
Muli-land I was only given a little vague informa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>tion
which may be far from accurate. Unfortunately
the dialect of Tibetan spoken by the lamas
who visited me was not always intelligible to
my servant, far less to myself, and I am by no
means satisfied that my questions were always
clearly understood, or that the replies given me
were properly interpreted. The Njong, I was
told, are the predominant race, and it is of
their language that I have given a few words
in the Appendix. I have suggested in another
place<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> that they may be more or less closely
connected with the Mo-so of to-day. Less
numerous are the Man-tzŭ (always a vague
term), Lolos, Pa-No, Po-Nyi and Pa-Chi. The
Pa-No and Po-Nyi, whoever they may be, appear
to have languages of their own. The Pa-Chi
are said to be of mixed Chinese and Man-tzŭ
descent, and speak a dialect which my servant
could make nothing of. Finally there are a
number of Miao-tzŭ, an aboriginal race of which
we still find vestiges in Kwang-si, Yunnan, Kuei-chou
and other parts of China. It was curious
to find representatives of that race or tribe so
far west as the borders of Tibet,<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a> and it would
be interesting to ascertain if they have preserved
any traditions of their origin. Unfortunately, it
does not seem likely that there are any educated
men among them. Even in Muli-land they are
a despised race, and are the only people who are
debarred from becoming lamas. The names of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
other race-types of Muli given in the <i lang="zh">T'ung Chih</i><a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a>
are somewhat puzzling, and I can make little of
them.</p>

<p>The lamas themselves are by no means well
educated, and apart from the lamas no one can
read or write. As in all countries where lamaism
has established itself, laymen are allowed and
indeed expected to remain in complete ignorance
of letters. In Burma and Siam, where a far
purer form of the Buddhist religion is observed,
the monks are the schoolmasters of the people,
and the monasteries are the village schools; but
no such scholastic work is undertaken by the
lamas of Tibetan countries, who believe that
nothing is worth studying except what is in their
sacred books, and that only lamas are worthy to
study them. It is no wonder that the people of
Tibet are the most ignorant and superstitious of
any semi-civilised race in Asia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEPARTURE FROM MULI</div>

<p>In manners and customs there does not seem
to be any particular in which Muli-land stands
alone. The dead bodies of both lamas and laymen
are disposed of by cremation. In the case
of lamas the ashes are carefully collected from
the funeral pyre, ground into fine powder and
preserved in urns. The cremated bodies of laymen
are treated with less respect, for the ashes
are merely thrown over precipices or into mountain
caverns.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a> In some parts of the eastern Tibetan
states&mdash;including those which like Chala and Muli<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
have been annexed to the Chinese empire&mdash;the
bodies of the dead are left exposed on the
mountain sides until every particle of flesh has
been torn off the bones by vultures and beasts
of prey;<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a> and elsewhere&mdash;especially in the case
of the very poor, who cannot afford the expense
of cremation&mdash;the corpses are simply thrown into
the nearest river, without any ceremony.</p>

<p>I rested at Muli from the 3rd of May&mdash;the
day of my arrival&mdash;till the morning of the 6th,
when I resumed my march towards Yunnan.
From Muli to Yung-ning, which is situated a
few miles beyond the border, is a journey of
three stages, and up to that point&mdash;or rather
to the frontier of Yunnan&mdash;my path continued
to lie through the territory of Muli. The lamas
did everything possible to render this part of my
journey pleasant. They granted me the privilege
of <i>ula</i> (for which I paid the same rates as in
the territory of Chala), sent an <i lang="fr">avant-courier</i> to
warn the villagers to give me proper treatment,
and deputed one of their probationers or <i lang="bo">tra-pa</i>
to escort me to Yung-ning. Our first stage was
a short one. We began by going up the valley
of the Rong Ch'u towards the S.S.W. About
4 miles from Muli we descended to the bed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
of the river, and crossed to the right bank. A
winding path led us up the steep slope of the
south side of the valley, and while we were still
not more than 7 miles from Muli we halted.
The prospect of a steep climb over a pass on the
following day seemed to break the spirit of my
followers, as they declared it was impossible to
proceed further that day. The pass is apparently
a notorious haunt of robbers. There was
a solitary farmhouse at the place where we
halted; but as it was rather more squalid and
filthy than usual, I decided to camp out of
doors. Towards evening a thunderstorm drove
me into the house, but I was speedily expelled
again by the smoke and charcoal fumes, and
established myself under an improvised awning
on the roof.</p>

<div class="caption">THE AUTHOR'S MULETEERS, NEAR YUNG-NING.</div>
</div>

<p>On the following day we had a long and somewhat
arduous march over the pass of Shi Li La,
the height of which is about 15,500 feet.<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a> The
path bears at first towards the east and south-east,
and gradually ascends to a ridge, which is separated
from the true summit by a narrow valley running
north-east and south-west. From this point to the
summit the climb would be easy in dry weather,
but the thawing snows made the path slippery
and disagreeable. From the summit we found
the descent at first steep and rocky, but, as soon
as we had left the snow behind us, we found
ourselves descending an easy road through a forest
containing many magnificent firs. Some of them
measured 15 feet in circumference, 5 feet above<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
the ground. Between 3,000 and 4,000 feet below
the summit of the pass, we crossed a stream,
and went uphill for a few hundred feet, thereafter
descending into a broken and very picturesque
valley, in the middle of which we found the first
inhabited spot we had seen in the course of a
30-mile ride. This was the hamlet of Li She
Tzŭ, the inhabitants of which are Mo-so, a race
of which I shall have more to say below.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> From
this point to Yung-ning, and some distance beyond
it, we found every village inhabited almost exclusively
by people of this race.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FRONTIER OF YUNNAN</div>

<p>Leaving Li She Tzŭ at dawn on 8th May, we
rode over an undulating road, generally wooded,
and at about 5 miles changed mules at the village
of Li Rang Tzŭ. This proved to be the last village
of Muli-land, and of the province of Ssuch'uan, for
a march of barely 4 miles beyond it led us across
the boundary of the province at the top of a low
range of wooded hills. We were then in Yunnan.
The descent into the next plain was steep,
and the road execrable. There we entered the
first of the Yunnanese villages&mdash;Djo-Dji&mdash;where
I was received by the local headman. Though
a Mo-so, he was acquainted with Chinese, as
well as his own language, and was attired in a
Chinese long coat with bright brass buttons
that had once adorned the uniform of a British
soldier. From a metal case which he held in his
hand he drew one of his cards. As he presented
it to me, he told me that he was well
acquainted with Western foreigners, for he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
seen two besides myself. They, he added, were
two Frenchmen, who had passed through the
village quite recently, and who&mdash;judging from his
description&mdash;must have been engaged in surveying.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a>
He spoke of them with great warmth of
feeling, for it appeared that they had presented
him with a valuable memento in the shape of
an empty sardine-tin. This was the metal box
which he had converted into a card-case, and of
which he was evidently very proud. The district
in which this village is situated is fairly rich and
well populated. A series of cultivated plains,
divided from each other by rounded hills, extends
the whole way from the frontier of the province
to the town of Yung-ning, which we reached after
passing through a number of prosperous villages,
inhabited by Mo-so, of which the largest were
Wo La, Yi Ma Wa, A-ko Am-ni Wa, and A-gu
Wa. In these villages the houses were nearly all
mere cabins, built of pine-logs, the roofs being
thin wooden boards weighted with heavy stones
to keep them from blowing away; but the dress
of the women is in striking contrast with the
poverty of their dwellings. Their hair, which is
roped round the head, is lavishly adorned with
strings of beads and silver ornaments, and their
skirts are brilliantly coloured.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> But while wife
and daughter are allowed to array themselves
in all the finery that the family possesses, the
husband is content to wear the meanest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
sackcloth, and carries no ornaments. Some of the
men, in imitation of the Chinese, shave the front
of their heads and wear queues.</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="YUNG-NING"></a>
<img src="images/i_229fp.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">YUNG-NING.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">RULER OF YUNG-NING</div>

<p>Yung-ning, in spite of the prominence given
to it on the maps, is a large straggling village
rather than a town. It has no walls, its houses
are humble structures mostly built of wood, and
its only conspicuous building is an imposing
lamasery. Its population is purely agricultural.
The people are of mixed Mo-so and Tibetan race,
and the prevailing religion is Lamaism. The town&mdash;if
it must be so called&mdash;is the capital of a district
bounded on the north and east by the provincial
frontier, on the south by the Yangtse or River
of Golden Sand, and the Chinese sub-prefecture
of Yung Pei, and on the west by the tribal district
of Chung-tien. The district of Yung-ning is ruled
by a hereditary native chief, a personage of less
importance than the "kings" of Chala and Muli,
but still of considerable rank and influence. Like
many other tribal chiefs who, during the last few
centuries have been brought by cajolery or force
of arms under the dominion of China, the Yung-ning
chief holds the hereditary rank of a Chinese
official. In China proper, as I need hardly say,
official rank is not hereditary; but in subduing
the wild "barbarian" districts of Ssuch'uan and
Yunnan the Chinese Government found their task
facilitated by making an ingenious compromise
with the chiefs. Each chieftain who placed himself
and his territory under the suzerainty of
China, and undertook to be guided in all matters
of political importance by Chinese advice, was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
only confirmed in his position as tribal ruler, but
received the title and rank of a Chinese official
to be borne by his heirs and successors in perpetuity.
The ruler of Yung-ning thus bears the
hereditary rank and title of prefect, and it is
for this reason that in the maps his capital is
marked as a <i lang="zh">fu</i> or prefecture. In all matters
affecting Chinese interests he is practically the
subordinate of the sub-prefect of Yung Pei, a
Chinese official whose rank is nominally inferior
to his own. Yung Pei is a small city lying about
six days' journey south of Yung-ning, forming the
centre of a Chinese administrative subdivision.</p>

<p>The day after my arrival at Yung-ning I
received a call from the chief. As he knew no
Chinese we had to converse through the medium
of his Chinese secretary. The chief was a young
man of about twenty-eight, amiable enough, but
intensely shy and ill at ease in the presence of a
foreigner. He wore the uniform of his Chinese
rank, and showed himself well acquainted with the
Chinese rules of ceremony and etiquette.</p>

<p>The plain of Yung-ning is situated about 9,500
feet above sea-level, in a warm latitude, and produces
a great variety of crops. Part of it is given
up to the cultivation of rice, for it is well watered
by a considerable stream, which bisects the town
and flows through the middle of the plain. I
saw here, for the first time since I had left central
Ssuch'uan, that patient and indispensable partner
of the Chinese ploughman in the rice-field, the
water-buffalo. The stream is named the K'ai Chi<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
and is spanned by a handsome stone bridge which,
according to the inscription on a tablet close by,
was rebuilt as recently as the thirtieth year of
the present reign (1905). The stream produces
excellent fish.</p>

<div class="sidenote">POLYANDRY</div>

<p>The town contains, besides quasi-Tibetans and
Mo-so, a considerable number of Li-so (Leesaw),
who speak a language of their own. During the
day and a half I spent in Yung-ning I took the
opportunity to note down a list of Li-so words,
in order that I might compare them with the
Mo-so words I had picked up during the three
days' march from Muli. The vocabularies will be
found in Appendix A.</p>

<p>In many respects the social customs of the
Mo-so are identical with those of eastern Tibet.
Polyandry, for example, prevails among them to
a great extent. It is quite common for a woman
to have three or four husbands, or even more.
With regard to the prevalence of this practice
in Tibetan countries, Baber<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> has observed the
curious fact that polygamy is the rule in the
valleys while polyandry prevails in the uplands,
the reason apparently being that women are
numerous in the valleys, where the work is light
and suitable to their capabilities, but form only a
small minority of the population of the mountains,
where the climate is severe and the work of the
herdsmen not suited to females. "The subject,"
he says, "raises many curious and by no means
frivolous questions, but I cannot help thinking
it singular that the conduct of courtship and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
matrimony should be regulated by the barometrical
pressure." In the Mo-so country, however, the
practice of polyandry seems to be almost, if not
quite, as prevalent among the people of the plains
as among those of the mountains; it exists, for
instance, in the villages situated on the banks of
the upper Yangtse, less than two days' journey
south of Yung-ning. The children of a woman
who has several husbands are apparently regarded
as the legitimate offspring of all of them: an
arrangement facilitated by the fact that the
husbands are generally closely related to each
other,<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a> and that the Mo-so, like the Tibetans,
have no regular surnames. In one of the Sino-Tibetan
states north-west of Tachienlu the
sovereign power is said to be always in the hands
of a woman. This is the principality of Sa-mong
(so spelled in Tibetan) in the north-east of Derge.
If this "regiment of women" is not connected
with an ancient matriarchal custom it may be the
result of ages of polyandry, though I am not aware<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
that the queen of Sa-mong takes to herself more
than one prince-consort.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">DISPOSAL OF THE DEAD</div>

<p>The funeral ceremonies of the Mo-so are much
the same as those of the Tibetans and the people
of Muli. The dead are generally cremated or left
to the vultures and beasts of prey. In case of
cremation, the ashes are scattered or thrown into
a ravine or river. Such rough-and-ready methods
of disposing of the dead seem to point back to a
time when the people that practise these customs
were nomads, having no fixed habitation and
unable to raise permanent memorials to their
dead. The Mo-so, who have settled close to the
banks of the Yangtse, hold the richest lands, and
are perhaps the most civilised members of their
race. They, perhaps influenced by the example
of the Chinese, seem to be gradually modifying
the national customs with regard to the disposal
of the dead. After cremation they carefully wash
the ashes in the waters of the Yangtse, and then
deposit them in artificial caves roughly hewn by
themselves out of the loose crumbling soil of the
river's right bank. But the ashes are not inurned,
and no record of the deceased is preserved on
tablets or monuments.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

<p class="center">YUNG-NING TO LI-CHIANG</p>


<p>At Yung-ning I parted with some regret from my
three Chinese soldiers&mdash;including Hoggins and
Bloggins&mdash;who had acted as my escort all the
way from Tachienlu. They had carried out
their orders to the letter in seeing me safely into
Yunnan, and in many ways had rendered me
faithful and valuable service. Attended by such
men a traveller in the wilds of Chinese Tibet
has indeed but little to complain of. They were
always cheerful, obedient and respectful, never
once grumbled at the hardships of the road or
the difficulties that we sometimes had about
obtaining food, and at the end of a day's journey
were always busy about my personal requirements
before they looked after themselves. I rewarded
them with treble the pay I had promised them at
Tachienlu, and still felt that I was in their debt.
They started off on the return journey in the
company of the lama who had acted as my guide
from Muli, and I was glad to learn some months
afterwards that they had arrived safely at
Tachienlu. The lama, of course, left them at
Muli. The Tibetan servant whom I had engaged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
at Tachienlu remained in my service for some
weeks longer, until I had arrived at T'êng-yüeh
near the frontier of Burma.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEPARTURE FROM YUNG-NING</div>

<p>I started from Yung-ning on 10th May, with
an unusually large retinue. The mountain pass
that separates the Yung-ning plain from the
Yangtse was said to be one of the most dangerous
roads in western China, owing to the presence
of large bands of Lolo robbers. The Yung-ning
chief was therefore kind enough to send no less
than twelve armed men to escort me to the banks
of the river. Two of the twelve were soldiers in
uniform; the rest were honest rustics who were
probably less afraid of the Lolos than of their
borrowed firearms, which on their own admission
they had never been taught to use. Our general
direction during the morning was W.S.W., over
an undulating road that at first led us through
cultivated fields and afterwards gradually ascended
the side of a wooded mountain. Early in the
afternoon we reached, after a long climb, the
summit of the Ge Wa pass or Ge Wa Ya K'ou,
the height of which is about 13,000 feet. From
the summit there was no view towards the south
as it was hidden by forests, but a backward glance
afforded a beautiful view of the Yung-ning plain,
the afternoon shining brightly on its many shades
of green. We descended the west side of the
pass by a bad road, and all distant views were
concealed until we had gone down about 3,000
feet. Then a panorama of very lofty mountains,
crowned with snow, opened out before us in the
south-west. After passing one or two log cabins<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
and a few fields of scanty vegetation we reached
our night's quarters in a sorry hut. The whole of
the next morning was occupied in continuing the
long descent to the Yangtse valley. The road is
not very steep, but the surface is crumbling and
rocky. We first caught sight of the great river
when we were between 2,000 and 3,000 feet above
it. The glimpse revealed to us a tortuous channel
of which the general direction was from north-west
to south-east. The mountains slope almost to the
water's edge on both sides, but there are several
small villages perched above the banks, and there
is a considerable amount of cultivation. Yet it
is curious to observe that the Chinese, as distinct
from the natives, are convinced that this broad
valley&mdash;like all other river-valleys in the west&mdash;is
dangerous to the health of "civilised" beings.
We had our midday meal outside a solitary house
called Lan Ga Lo, not far from which is a village.
Thence we descended, always in full view of the
river, to the village of La Ka Shi, which lies close
to a small stream called the Si Dji or Si river.
From there we proceeded along the left bank of
the Yangtse, two or three hundred feet above it,
for a distance of half a mile, then descended to
the water's edge by a very steep zig-zagged path.</p>

<div class="figcenter" ><a id="THE_YANGTSE_RIVER"></a>
<img src="images/i_236fp.jpg"  alt="" />
<div class="caption">THE YANGTSE RIVER, NEAR YUNG-NING, ABOVE THE FERRY.</div>
</div>

<p>The crossing of the river was effected by means
of a ferry-boat; but, as there was only one boat
and we had mules to take across, it was not till two
hours afterwards that we were all safely deposited
with our baggage on the right bank. It was
difficult work to get the animals into the boat.
The second boat-load (consisting of two of them)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
nearly found a watery grave, for a mule became
panic-stricken when the boat was only a third of
the way across, and stamped about so much that
the rather crazy craft sprang a leak and had to be
hurried back. The current was much less swift
than that of the Yalung, and we were not carried
down stream more than about 30 yards during the
passage; but we were told by the ferryman that the
water had only recently begun to rise above the
usual winter level. The melting snows in summer
naturally make a great difference in the speed of
the current and the level of the water. Where
we crossed, the river was more than 100 yards
broad, but just above that point it forces its way
through a narrow channel formed by some jutting
rocks.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> The rapids render the river quite unnavigable.
The height of the Yangtse above sea-level
at this point is about 5,200 feet. A local
Chinese name for this portion of the river is Pai
Shui Ho ("White Water River"), but, like all
rivers fed by melting snows and glaciers, it was
very brown and muddy when we crossed it. The
Mo-so name is Gi Dji, which simply means "The
River."</p>

<p>It is only within the last ten years that
geographers have known anything about the
great bend in the Yangtse that brings it to
within a day's journey of Yung-ning. The bend
is, of course, caused by the vast mountain range
that extends to the north of Li-chiang&mdash;a range
that proved impenetrable even to the turbulent
waters of the greatest river in China, and forced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
it to take a northerly course that added scores
of miles to its total length. M. Bonin was, I
believe, the first traveller to make this discovery,
and his observations were subsequently confirmed
by Major Davies and Major Ryder.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a></p>

<p>On reaching the right (south) bank of the
Yangtse, we at once commenced a stiff uphill
climb. Close to the river's edge I noticed some
of the small artificial caves or recesses mentioned
above,<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a> in connection with the burial customs of
the Mo-so. Not far from these, but not quite
so close to the river's edge, were a number of
holes, large enough to admit a man, and partly
covered by loose planks. These, I was told, were
the shafts of gold-mines, but I could get no
information as to the output, and no doubt the
methods of working are exceedingly primitive.
When I asked my guides whether the gold of
this district had not attracted Chinese miners,
they told me a naïve story of how some years
ago some Chinese "from the east" came and
set up a mining establishment there, ruthlessly
driving the natives to the neighbouring mountains.
Soon afterwards the Chinese miners found themselves
harassed day and night by continuous
showers of stones and rocks, which killed not a
few of their number and wrecked their huts.
After patiently enduring these calamities for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
few days, without hope of being able to retaliate,
they picked up their belongings and quietly fled
away, doubtless regretting their foolhardiness in
tampering with the prescriptive rights of the
quarrelsome barbarians.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a></p>

<div class="caption">THE YANGTSE RIVER AT THE FERRY.</div>
</div>


<div class="sidenote">MO-SO AND LI-SO</div>

<p>Several hundred feet above the gold-mines I
passed some old graves&mdash;not unlike a type of
grave often seen in China proper. One of my
mule-drivers, a Mo-so, could only tell me that
they were the tombs of <i>pên-ti-jên</i>, which means
nothing but "the natives," and is therefore not
a very enlightening expression to use in a country
inhabited by three or four different races, none
of which has any exact knowledge of how it
came there. The predominant races between the
Yunnan frontier, north of Yung-ning, and the
town of Li-chiang are undoubtedly Mo-so and
Li-so, but that there are tribal differences among
them seems to be evident from the fact that the
Mo-so north of the Yangtse are under the rule
of the chief whom I met at Yung-ning, while
south of that river they are subject to another
chief who resides at Li-chiang. At one time,
indeed, it is well known that all the Mo-so were
governed by a king whose capital was at Li-chiang,
but the present Li-chiang chief&mdash;whose
influence is gradually waning owing to Chinese
encroachments&mdash;is not the representative of the
ancient Mo-so king.</p>

<p>After climbing about 2,000 feet above the
river, we halted for the night in the flourishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
village of Fêng K'o, where I found excellent
quarters in the upper story of an empty house.
Next day we crossed the little upland valley in
which Fêng K'o is situated, and gradually ascended
along the mountain-side in a south-westerly direction,
following to some extent the course of the
river now far below us. About 3 miles from Fêng
K'o we turned west into a defile, having in front
of us, to the south and south-west, a range of
rocky mountains with snowy peaks probably over
18,000 feet high. Another 2 or 3 miles brought us
to a brisk, clear stream, which we followed up to
a little temple or shrine close by which the water
bubbles out of a fountain in a rock. The water
is excellent, and there is good camping-ground for
a small party. I strongly recommend travellers
who may traverse this route hereafter to make this
a stage if possible. Lightly-equipped travellers
might make it the second stage from Yung-ning,
and heavily-laden caravans might make it the
third. From this attractive spot we marched
steadily uphill for a few miles and rested outside
a couple of cottages. Thence, after a luncheon of
eggs, we resumed our upward journey for several
hours, finally following an undulating track along
one of the mountain ridges. It began to cloud over
about this time. The tops of the neighbouring
mountains were hidden in mist, and towards
evening rain fell heavily. This part of the
country is a dreary waste of wild mountains
without a trace of human habitation. We went
on till nightfall, then camped in the forest.
As we had no tent, and were sheltered only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
by the gaunt arms of fir-trees, the prospects of a
comfortable night were somewhat dismal; but
fortunately the rain ceased to fall before midnight
and we were troubled only by the dripping
branches. In one respect the rain was useful, as
it afforded us all the water we required for
drinking and cooking purposes. We had found
no spring-water in this part of the forest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CAMP IN THE FOREST</div>

<p>The rain began to fall again next day while we
were at breakfast, and continued off and on all
the morning. In the afternoon it cleared up, and
for the rest of the way to Li-chiang the weather
was perfect. Our road gradually led us uphill,
and took us over the pass known by the Mo-so as
Go Ka A, the height of which is about 15,000
feet. The descent is steep and rocky. Both sides
of the pass are well wooded. All the afternoon
we continued to descend, and towards evening
reached a cultivated valley surrounded by an
amphitheatre of hills. Here there was a scattered
hamlet named T'o Ko Sho&mdash;the first village we
had seen since we left Fêng K'o. While we were
resting outside one of the cottages I saw a man
going out to shoot pheasants with a bow and
arrows.<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> As we did not await his return I am
unable to give any opinion as to his skill. A few
miles beyond T'o Ko Sho we camped in the forest
at the end of a marshy meadow, which gave
pasture to our beasts and supplied (from a brook)
good water for ourselves. The forest is said to
be infested with panthers; but they gave us no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
trouble. I was somewhat disturbed, however, by
a very large and obstinate species of mosquito.
Next day the road undulated in a southerly
direction through the forest. We soon caught
sight of some lofty and magnificent snowy peaks
to the south-west&mdash;the mountains that tower some
10,000 feet above the Li-chiang plain which itself
lies at an elevation of over 8,000 feet. A few more
miles brought us to the village of Ming Yin Chi,<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a>
which with its almost-Chinese architecture, its
likin-station and familiar official notices (the first
seen since the first day's journey from Tachienlu),
reminded us that we were entering a country
where the direct influence of China succeeded in
making itself felt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ON THE ROAD TO LI-CHIANG</div>

<p>The houses of Ming Yin Chi are mostly
built of wood, but there are a few tiled roofs.
The dress of the people is hardly distinguishable
from that of the Chinese, except in the
massive ear-rings and other ornaments worn by
the women. Their feet, of course, are unbound.
Outside the village likin-station I saw a versified
proclamation in Chinese, referring to the dangerous
state of the roads of the neighbourhood owing to
the prevalence of brigandage, and offering rewards
for the capture of the robbers. Leaving this
village behind us we soon passed again into the
forest, the road lying through a fairly level park-like
country studded with noble pines. We continued
our journey till sunset and again camped
in the forest. So still and peaceful was the night
that my candle burned with as steady a flame as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
if it were inside a lantern. Next morning we
began by climbing uphill out of the hollow in
which we had camped to a <i>col</i> rather over 10,000
feet in elevation. The road then led rapidly downhill
for about 3 miles and brought us to a
narrow valley through which flows a stream called
the Hei Shui ("Black Water"). Here I observed
a sight which unfortunately is only too rare in
China&mdash;the building of a new bridge. It was in
fact one of three new bridges crossed during this
day's journey. A party of workmen was busily
engaged in top-dressing the surface of the bridge,
which was almost finished, and as it is considered
unlucky in China to use a new bridge before it is
opened to traffic, I crossed by a temporary wooden
structure a few yards lower down. The inevitable
tablet commemorating the erection of the bridge
and the names of the givers&mdash;for it had nothing
to do with Government&mdash;was already in position
on the right bank of the river. Beside this tablet
is a smaller one dedicated to the Spirit of the
Road. Soon after crossing the Black Water the
road turns to the right, southwards.</p>

<p>Another road, which looks like a continuation
of the old one, descends through the valley of the
stream, and as I was then on foot and far ahead of
my caravan I followed this road for some <i>li</i> without
guessing it was the wrong one. So I had to
retrace my steps, to find that the road to Li-chiang
climbs over three successive small passes, divided
from each other by a series of ravines. I expected
when I reached each summit&mdash;the highest being
about 11,000 feet in elevation&mdash;to find the city<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
of Li-chiang lying at my feet, but I beheld
only forests and the great snowy peaks. The
descent from the third pass led into a barren
stony valley which was once, in all probability,
the bed of a glacier. If appearances are not very
deceptive the shrunken glacier can still be seen
high up on the mountains, some distance below
the snow-line. The stony valley is the northern
section of the Li-chiang plain, but though we had
no more climbing we had a long and rather
wearisome march of between 10 and 20 miles
before we reached the city. The first section
of the valley&mdash;absolutely bare and uninhabited&mdash;is
approximately rather less than 2 miles broad, and
on each side are scantily-wooded hills. The snowy
summits towered above us on our right. The
valley seems almost level, and one can gaze over
its whole extent from almost any point, but it has
a gentle slope towards the south. After traversing
a belt of shrubby wilderness the desert gradually
transformed itself into a delightful garden.
The principal crop in the cultivated part of the
Li-chiang plain is opium, and the pure white
flower of the poppy-plant was in full bloom.
Among the most attractive features of the plain
are its hedges and wild-flowers&mdash;especially its
luxuriant white wild-roses, the most beautiful I
have ever seen. The air was deliciously fresh and
warm and laden with the scent of flowers, and it
was only when we caught sight of the huge wintry
mountains gazing icily down upon us from the
sky that we were forced to remember that "it is
not always May."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">ARRIVAL AT LI-CHIANG</div>

<p>An excellent broad road&mdash;one of the very best
I have seen in China&mdash;traverses the greater part
of the cultivated portion of the valley. A dogcart
might be driven over it with perfect safety,
and in many places it is broader than a good
English country road. It is lined on both sides
with luxuriant untrimmed hedges, beyond which
lie beautiful Gardens of Sleep&mdash;acres of white
poppy. Villages are numerous in the plain, but
our road did not take us through many of them.
One&mdash;the village of Pei Sha&mdash;through which we
rode just as the sun was setting, was very
picturesque with its wild-flowers and palm-trees.
The road degenerated as we approached the city.
It had once been paved and was no doubt an
excellent causeway in time past; but as usual in
China the paving-stones had sunk crookedly and
had not been repaired. It was dark before we
arrived at the end of our unusually long day's
journey, and in the hedges of the suburbs glimmering
glow-worms took the place of the wild-roses
that night had rendered invisible.</p>

<p>Li-chiang is a small unwalled town, only
dignified by the name of a city because it is
the administrative centre of a prefecture and a
district magistracy. As the capital of the old
Mo-so kingdom its situation was well chosen,
for in the days of border warfare the strategic
importance of its position must have been considerable.
It stands on a small hill commanding
the greater part of the plain, and is within comparatively
easy reach of the Yangtse ferries, both
on the east and on the west. No doubt the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
Mo-so, in the days of their strength, made a
point of holding the crossings at both places.
Li-chiang is still the residence of a Mo-so or
Nashi (Lashi) chief, but his influence is steadily
waning. The great majority of the inhabitants
are of mixed race, the predominating types being
Mo-so, Li-so, Lolo and Min-chia.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> There is also
a pure Chinese element, which is gradually tending
to increase. Li-chiang is a considerable
centre of trade, and is visited by large numbers
of Tibetans and "Ku-tsung" from Atuntzŭ and
the valley of the Mekong, and also by traders
from Tali-fu, Yunnan-fu, Yung Pei and the
Chien-ch'ang valley. There is a broad marketplace
in the middle of the town, almost constantly
occupied by loquacious crowds of buyers
and sellers of many races. There is a good deal
of green foliage in the outskirts, and much
deflected water which flows through some of the
streets like little canals. To a casual observer
the streets are not very unlike those of an
ordinary town in China: the shops have much
the same outward appearance, and the same
charactered sign-boards hang above their doors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">REST AT LI-CHIANG</div>

<p>The morning after my arrival at Li-chiang,
where I found accommodation in a very bad
inn, I heard the surprising and welcome news
that there were two Englishmen staying in the
town, one of them being a consular official and
the other a railway surveyor. As I had no
idea that the British Government of Burma had
any present intention of extending their railway<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
system to northern Yunnan I decided to call
upon my compatriots and ascertain if such were
the case. In the course of my enquiries into
their place of residence I discovered that one of
the Englishmen had left the town some days
before, and that the other was a Frenchman!
It finally turned out that the former was a
Mr Forrest, the adventurous botanist to whose
narrow escape from torture and death at the
hands of the lamas I have already referred.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> He
had been making a short stay in Li-chiang,
and had just left on a botanical expedition to
the neighbouring hills. The Frenchman was
M. Gaston Perronne, a merchant, who was
engaged in the purchase of musk. He had taken
a Chinese house in Li-chiang for the period of
his residence there, and when I called upon him
he most kindly insisted upon my staying with
him until I left Li-chiang. Instead of leaving on
the following day, therefore, as I had intended,
I remained in Li-chiang from the evening of the
15th May to the morning of the 18th.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

<p class="center">LI-CHIANG TO TALI-FU</p>


<p>I was now bound for Tali-fu, having bargained
with a new set of muleteers to take me there in
five days. I was anxious to press on as rapidly
as possible, not only because I was now on
ground that had several times been traversed
and described by other Europeans, but also
because the rainy season was just beginning, and
might seriously hamper my movements in crossing
the mountains and rivers beyond Tali-fu. I
had not yet decided whether to proceed to
Burma by the T'êng-yüeh-Bhamo route or to
attempt to reach Lashio (the terminus of the
British Shan States railway system) by Yün-chou
and the Kunlon Ferry. My host, M. Perronne,
was a thorough believer in the deadly unhealthiness
of the Salwen valley in the rainy season,
and assured me that it would be madness to
attempt to cross it till the autumn. I decided,
however, to wait till I reached Tali-fu before
coming to a decision.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SHOOTING A MUD-DEVIL</div>

<p>From Li-chiang my road lay in a westerly
direction over a portion of the plain that I had
not yet traversed. Roses, meadow-sweet, primroses
and other wild-flowers made the hedges<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
smell of England. We left the plain behind us
by crossing a low range of hills from which we
descended into another plain called the Lashi-Pa,
in which there is a small lake. Here I was
shown a path that leads west towards the Ashi
Ferry on the Yangtse, only a few miles distant,
and so leads to Chung-tien and Atuntzŭ.<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> The
last-named place, I may mention incidentally, is
said to exist no longer, part of it having been
destroyed by a gigantic landslip, and the rest
having been demolished in the recent war between
the Chinese and the lamas. The landslip appears
to have been an extraordinary occurrence, and
was perhaps caused by an earthquake. Torrents
of mud and stones tore like an avalanche down
the side of the mountain at the base of which
Atuntzŭ was situated, demolishing houses, destroying
all growing crops, and burying alive whole
families. The local officials dealt with the catastrophe
in an interesting and characteristic manner.
Possessed, apparently, by the idea that the moving
masses of mud were directed and controlled by
a malevolent devil, they armed themselves with
muzzle-loading guns and bows and arrows, and
went out and shot the mud. In due time the
torrent ceased to flow, and no doubt it was
universally believed that the devil had been slain
by arrows and bullets. The harm already done,
unfortunately, was irreparable, and what remained
of the town has since, as I have said, fallen a
prey to warfare.</p>

<p>My road instead of going west to the Yangtse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
bore away southwards to the left of the lake, and
brought us about midday to the village of Shang
La Shih or Upper Lashi, where I lunched. The
plain contains several other villages, but its soil
seems hardly so rich as that of the plain of Li-chiang.
In the afternoon, after crossing a pass of
no great elevation, we dropped down to a third
valley and stopped for the night at the hamlet
of Kuan Hsia, also called P'o Chiao.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a> About
here I observed a good deal of ruddy soil, which
reminds one of the red sand-stone basin of
Ssuch'uan. There is also a small lake or tarn.
During the whole of the next day we traversed
the same valley, passing through many prosperous
and populous villages. The valley is indeed only
a narrow strip of fertile land between more or
less barren ranges of hill, but what there is would
be amply sufficient to support a very large population.
The road is very fair, and at one time was
probably an excellent highway. There are the
remains of drinking-fountains along the road, and
many of the bridges are still admirable and substantial
pieces of work. It would I think be a
mistake to say that all the decay is traceable to
the ravages of the Mohammedan rebellion of the
seventies. The decay had probably set in&mdash;here
as elsewhere in China&mdash;long before that lurid
episode had drenched the province of Yunnan
in seas of blood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MIN-CHIA</div>

<p>On leaving the Li-chiang plain we had left
behind us the country of the Mo-so or Lashi,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
and had entered a district that is perhaps chiefly
inhabited by a race known to the Chinese as <i lang="zh">Min-chia</i>,<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a>
which simply means "the people" or "the
families of people." The mystery that surrounds
the origin of all the tribes I have mentioned clings
no less obstinately to the Min-chia. They are a
very interesting and amiable people, fair in face,
and with clear bold eyes that do not shun to meet
the gaze of a stranger. The women, if less handsome
and imposing than the tall women of eastern
Tibet, have a grace and prettiness of their own,
that would, I feel sure, be found exceedingly
attractive by impressionable Europeans. Two
days north of Tali-fu I saw a Min-chia child who
would be considered beautiful in any western
country. She was standing alone in a poppy-field,
singing a song in a language that was certainly
very different from Chinese.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Will no one tell me what she sings?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For old, unhappy, far-off things<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And battles long ago."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But the subject of the song mattered little. The
child made as pretty a picture as I had ever seen
in China.</p>

<p>My second day's journey from Li-chiang took
me through a large number of villages, of which
the names of the most important will be found in
the itinerary. At midday we reached the departmental
city of Chien-ch'uan-chou, a small town
which sits among a crowd of small centres of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
population, like a hen among her chickens. It is
surrounded by a battlemented wall of the usual
type, which gives it an appearance of compactness,
but in origin it was probably merely an agglomeration
of villages. Its population is mainly employed
in tilling the surrounding fields. A few miles
further we passed near the shores of a small
shallow lake, from which flows a small river called
the Hai Wei.<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> Just beyond the village of Han
Têng, where a market was being held, we crossed
the river by a handsome bridge, and almost
immediately afterwards arrived at the last village
of the long valley through which we had been
riding all day. This was the village of Tien Wei,
where we spent the night. Good quarters were
provided for us in a hostelry which was quite new
and therefore comparatively clean.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TALI-FU MOUNTAINS</div>

<p>Since leaving the high mountains north of
Li-chiang we seemed to have entered a new
climate. Riding and walking during the day
under a blazing sun, and with a shade temperature
of 80° F., proved to be much more exhausting
than climbing snowy mountains. We were now
on the high Yunnan plateau, at an average elevation
of about 7,000 feet; but we were gradually
approaching a tropical latitude, and the season&mdash;just
before the breaking of the rains&mdash;was the
hottest of the year. I had long since discarded
the thick garments which in the mountains near
the Yalung had seemed none too warm. The
nights and early mornings, however, were always
deliciously cool, and I was well aware that in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
steaming plains of Burma I should long for the
comparative coolness of the Yunnan plateau. At
Tien Wei the temperature an hour before our
early start sank as low as 54°, and we made haste to
get well on the road before the sun rose high in
the heavens. Out of the valley our road lay over
a picturesque range of low hills over-grown chiefly
with dwarf pines. On leaving these behind we
found ourselves in a small valley studded with a
few villages, from which we ascended another and
a higher range. From its northern slopes I had
a last view of Li-chiang's snow-clad peaks, and
half a mile further on we came within sight of
another range of snow-crowned hills to the south.
This was the lofty range&mdash;never perhaps absolutely
free from snow in spite of its latitude<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a>&mdash;which
forms the magnificent background to the city of
Tali-fu, now little more than two days distant.
At the foot of the hills from which we had this
view we came to a small temple and an eating-house,
close to a stream crossed by a bridge called
Hao Shou. The first word is the Chinese for a
crane, a bird which is emblematic of longevity,
and <i lang="zh">shou</i> is the ordinary word for "long life"; so
it is evidently intended that this bridge should last
for ever. Here we halted for lunch, I secluding
myself from public observation within the little
temple.</p>

<p>About 8 miles further on we passed through
the village of Niu Kai,<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a> which means Ox Village,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
just beyond which we passed close to a curious
hill which has the appearance of a truncated
cone. It is flattened at the top, and there is a
small pagoda. Hot springs issue from the base
of this hill, which bears the name of Huo Yen
Shan ("Fiery Flame Hill"). Perhaps it was once
a miniature volcano. I may mention, by the
way, that the valley through which we travelled
the previous day has within the last fifteen years
suffered from a disastrous earthquake, which is
said to have destroyed many villages and dozens
of lives.<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a> A short distance beyond the hot-spring
hill we halted at a good inn in the small market
town of San Ying, the name of which (meaning
Three Camps) seems to indicate that it was once
a military centre, perhaps in the days of the
Mongol invasions. In this town I bought myself
an umbrella for the sum of 600 cash&mdash;about one
shilling. It professed to be of English make, and
to have come from Rangoon in Burma; but the
mis-spelling of the name of a well-known Anglo-Indian
firm, and the obvious inferiority of the
manufacture, showed that it was only a crude
imitation. If this is the kind of article that
passes current for English goods in the west of
China it is little wonder that the trade between
Burma and Yunnan is not showing the elasticity
which is desirable from the point of view of the
material interests of both China and Great Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE WHITE SAND RIVER</div>

<p>Next day we continued our march through the
valley in which San Ying is situated, passing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
numerous farm-houses and small villages surrounded
with rice and poppy-fields. The rosebushes
which had so frequently lined our path
since we entered the Li-chiang plain had by
this time shed all their blossoms. The poppy-flowers,
too, were rapidly vanishing. Under the
brilliant sunshine the country still looked very
charming; the landscapes being very often of the
kind that would have delighted the heart of a
Corot. After passing through the village of
Ch'ang Ying (Long Camp) a few miles' ride
brought us to the southern termination of the
valley, and thence the road wound gradually up
the slope of low hills, mostly consisting of barren
moorland. We passed a small lake or tarn, and
after this the road turned south-west and brought
us to the large village of Ying-shan-p'u, situated
in a confined valley lying between two ranges
of hills. We skirted the left side of this village
close under a temple and small pagoda. We
then went southwards into a ravine, near the
entrance of which is a fine single-arch bridge
spanning a large stream called the Pai Sha or
White Sand. Our road did not lie across the
bridge, but continued to lead us along the stream's
left bank. The scenery in the gorge is picturesque,
but the hills on both sides are barren. Little
besides the prickly pear seems to thrive on them.
About 3 miles beyond the bridge we emerged
from the ravine into a plain. Here the Pai Sha
flows with a much slower current, and in size
attains the dignity of a small river. Its waters
have been brought under complete control by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
formation of well-constructed embankments. For
a distance of several miles, indeed, the river becomes
a canal, suitable for barge-traffic. Our road led
us along the embankment, and for a distance of
over a mile&mdash;all the way to the village of Chung
So&mdash;the road is not unlike the Magdalen Walks at
Oxford. The foliage is thicker and the vegetation
more luxuriant and diversified than at Magdalen,
but the road bears a general resemblance to
Addison's Walk, and the river is very similar to
the Cherwell in its width, in the laziness of its
current, and&mdash;be it confessed&mdash;in its colour.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a> At
a poor inn in the village of Chung So we made
our midday halt. A plague of flies drove me
away from it sooner than was pleasing to my
muleteers; but not before I had been cajoled
into entering my name in a subscription book
as a contributor towards the cost of rebuilding
the Tê Yüan Bridge which spans the Pai Sha
close by.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PLAIN OF TALI</div>

<p>After crossing this river and passing through
or within sight of several other villages we arrived
at the small departmental city of Têng-ch'uan-chou.
Our road took us in at one gate and out
at another. It seemed to be a sleepy town and
somewhat decadent. It lies not far from the
northern extremity of the famous Tali lake, the
Erh Hai, a great part of which came into view
as soon as we had ascended some rising ground,
mostly consisting of red clay, a short distance
beyond Têng-ch'uan. The lake is said to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
annually decreasing in volume, and to judge from
the appearance of the land beyond its northern
extremity this seems very likely to be true. Near
Têng-ch'uan there are a number of little isolated
ponds which evidently once formed part of the
great lake, and there is a great deal of marshy
land not yet fit for cultivation.</p>

<p>We spent the night of 21st May in a good inn
near the lake side in the village of Sha P'ing.
Next day we passed through Shang Kuan, the
fortified village, now partly in ruins, which once
formed one of the main bulwarks of the city of
Tali-fu. Between the base of the high mountains
on the west and the waters of the lake on the
east lies a strip of land between 20 and 30
miles long, and about 3 miles broad. At each
extremity of this plain is&mdash;or rather was&mdash;a
fortress. The northern extremity is protected by
Shang Kuan, the southern by Hsia Kuan&mdash;the
two words meaning the Upper and Lower Passes
or Gates. Tali-fu itself lies at the foot of the
mountains about 18 miles from the former and
7 miles from the latter, and used to be absolutely
safe from attack so long as those two fortified
points remained intact. The plain, which was
once in all probability under water, is very rich
and grows every kind of grain that a beleaguered
garrison could require. It was always safe against
starvation, therefore, in the event of a long siege.
It was only when artillery cast by Frenchmen in
Yunnan-fu was brought to bear upon the walls of
the two "Kuans" that the Mohammedan rebels
were forced at last to yield the city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span></p>

<p>The plain was not, when I rode through it on my
last stage to Tali-fu, devoted exclusively to cereals.
Hundreds of acres were given up to the opium-poppy,
and thousands of men and women were
at that time employed in harvesting the drug.
Much of the work was carried on by Min-chia
girls, who turn their healthy bronzed faces, shaded
by great straw sun-bonnets, to peer curiously at
the novel sight of a Western stranger. Some of
the women in this district wear turbans of dark
blue cloth, the front band studded with silver
knobs, which from a distance make it appear as
if their foreheads were crowned with some kind
of tiara. Beyond Shang Kuan the road lies at
a distance of about 3 miles from the lake all the
way to Tali-fu. Between the road and the lake
lies an endless series of cultivated fields, which
even in this dry season were plentifully irrigated
by streams from the mountain. The plain is
dotted with villages which generally lie half
buried in foliage. On the right of the road<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> the
cultivation is much more scanty. There is a
good deal of barren moorland, and much ground
is occupied by graves. Just before reaching Tali-fu
we passed some lofty thirteen-story pagodas.
I entered the city by the north gate and found
good quarters on the upper floor of a quiet and
commodious inn.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TALI LAKE</div>

<p>The city itself is neither more nor less attractive
than dozens of other Chinese cities. Its numerous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
ruined houses, however, have a pathetic interest
of their own, for they are just in the same condition
as they were immediately after the great siege.
Even after thirty-five years of peace Tali-fu has
not recovered from the disasters of those terrible
days. I spent two days and three nights in
Tali-fu, during which time I explored the city,
and wandered for miles beyond its walls.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a> Late
one afternoon I found myself by the lake side.
The view of those tranquil waters, overshadowed
as they were by the great mountain-barrier on
the west, was very beautiful. The blue surface
of the lake was dotted with crowds of white sails
rose-tinted with the light of the setting sun.
Nearer at hand crowds of wild-duck floated in
the midst of rippling circles, showing but little
fear of the noisy little boys who swam and dived
as skilfully as themselves, and whose splashing
and glad laughter were almost the only sounds
that broke the utter peacefulness of a perfect
summer evening. Very different was that terrible
scene which only a generation ago was enacted
by the shores of the Tali-fu lake, when its blue
waters were incarnadined with blood and its now
peaceful shores rang with the despairing cries
of thousands of homeless women and children.
For it was Tali-fu and the borders of its lake
that in 1873 witnessed the last and most tragic
events of the great Mohammedan rebellion.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> Tu<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
Wên-hsiu, the so-called "Sultan," who had so
long and successfully defied all the military power
of China, had fixed his court at Tali and had
converted it into what he believed to be an impregnable
stronghold. The closing scene of the
great conflict which devastated the whole province
of Yunnan, and converted many of its most flourishing
towns into blackened ruins, has been several
times described, but nowhere so graphically as in
the account by M. Emile Rocher,<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> the brilliant
and sympathetic Frenchman who was an eyewitness
of much that took place during the course
of that terrible civil war. The following is a
crude translation of his account of the events
that occurred when all hope of holding Tali-fu
against the imperial troops had been abandoned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEATH OF THE SULTAN OF TALI</div>

<p>"Tu Wên-hsiu ... awaited with resignation
the hour that would deliver him from his last
agonies. His wives and several of his children,
being unwilling to survive him, poisoned themselves
in his presence, and the day before he left
the palace he caused all articles of value that he
possessed to be destroyed, or, if they could not
be broken, to be thrown into the lake. On the
15th January 1873, Tu Wên-hsiu arrayed himself
in his handsomest robes of ceremony, and playing
the part of a sovereign to the very end of his
career, ordered the preparation of his yellow palanquin&mdash;yellow
being a colour that none but the
emperor of China had the right to use. Before
leaving his palace, he bade a last farewell to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
city in which the best years of his life had been
passed, and gazed for the last time on the chain
of mountains, the 'Azure Hills'<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> on which he
had loved to ramble. Before leaving his apartments
he swallowed a ball of opium.... The
road which his retinue had to follow in order to
reach the south gate was crowded with people
who came to prostrate themselves before their
Sultan for the last time. It was a solemn procession,
and many people who had not always
had reason to praise the administration of the
fallen Sultan could not hide their emotion. Tu
Wên-hsiu, whose senses the poison had begun
to paralyse, seemed to be little affected by what
went on around him. Arriving at the gate of
the city he made a great effort to get out of the
palanquin in order to thank the people and the
leaders who had accompanied him, and his children
were commended by him to the care of Yang
Wei.<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a> An escort of soldiers, sent by Yang Yü-k'o,<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a>
conducted him to the village occupied by
that general. The latter treated the vanquished
chief with respect, and asked him several questions,
to which, however, Tu Wên-hsiu had difficulty
in responding. Seeing that he could only extract
confused words out of the Sultan, whose moments
were numbered, the general sent him on to
Hsiao Kuan-i, where the Governor of Yunnan was
residing, in order that the latter might at least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
see him alive. He was already too late ... the
Sultan breathed his last shortly after his arrival,
towards seven in the evening.... The next day
the Governor caused his head to be cut off, and
a courier specially charged with the burden was
sent post haste to the capital of the province,
where the head was placed in honey for preservation
before being sent on to Peking."</p>

<p>Baber, who visited Tali-fu a few years after these
events, adds a graphic and pathetic touch, the truth
of which was amply vouched for. He says that
when Tu Wên-hsiu was brought into the presence
of the imperialist general he begged with his last
breath that the conquerors would be merciful.
"I have nothing to ask but this&mdash;spare the people."
This request&mdash;which Baber describes as perhaps
the most impressive and pathetic ever uttered
by a dying patriot&mdash;was treated with disregard.
The real tragedy came later, and is described
by M. Rocher in a passage which I translate as
follows: "The Governor, under pretext of celebrating
the surrender of the city, invited all the
Mohammedan leaders to a great banquet....
He received them very well, loaded them with
praises, and, just as they were going into the
banquet hall, the soldiers who had been placed
in readiness for the event seized upon the doomed
guests. Seventeen heads simultaneously rolled on
the ground. The Governor then gave the order
for six guns to be fired, the signal already agreed
upon for the commencement of the massacre in
the city. It was the eleventh day of the occupation.
What followed is indescribable.... After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
three days of this human butchery, Tali and its
environs presented a pitiable spectacle. Out of a
population of fifty thousand men, thirty thousand
had perished during those fatal days, and the rest
were all dispersed."</p>

<div class="sidenote">MASSACRE AT TALI-FU</div>

<p>There is some reason to believe that the number
of those said to have been slain was largely
exaggerated. Curiously enough the leaders of the
imperial armies who, according to our Western
notions, should have been zealous to hush up the
whole grim episode, were the first to spread abroad
the news of the massacre and to magnify the
numbers of the slaughtered; not because they
took any delight in the butchery for its own sake,
but because they wished to strike such terror
into the scattered bands of rebels who were still
at large that they would no longer have the heart
to strive against the great emperor whose armies
they had defied for seventeen years. That the
wholesale slaughter cannot by any possibility be
excused, goes without saying. But it is only
fair to remember that the great object which the
imperial leaders had before them was to inflict
so terrible a chastisement on the rebels that they
would never again be able to threaten the stability
of the empire. That object was attained. Had
any considerable body of men been spared it is
highly probable that they would merely have
carried on the warfare from another centre, and
protracted, for another decade, the strife and
bloodshed which had already devastated the
province of Yunnan for nearly twenty years, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
reduced the population&mdash;so it is estimated&mdash;from
eight millions to one.</p>

<p>Two years before the end, Tu Wên-hsiu made
a great effort to prop up his falling cause by
securing the help of Great Britain. With this
view he despatched his son to England in 1871,
and as a token of his desire to become the vassal
of the British Crown he sent Queen Victoria four
pieces of rock hewn out of the four corners of
the great Tali mountain. "Our unsentimental
Foreign Office," as Baber says, "blind to romantic
symbolism, would not suffer them to be extricated
from the bonded warehouse of the Customs;" at
any rate the Sultan and his unfortunate followers
were left to their doom, and the Dragon flag flew
once more over the walls of Tali. The mountain,
if it could think and feel, might perhaps console
itself for the contempt shown to its corner-stones
with the reflection that since its history began
nations have grown up and passed away like the
wild-flowers that live and die on its green slopes,
and that the great thrones and dynasties of to-day
will have become empty names, signifying nothing,
long before its jewelled fingers cease to traffic with
the eternal stars, or to duplicate themselves in the
still waters of the Tali lake.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

<p class="center">ETHNOLOGY OF THE CHINESE FAR WEST</p>


<p>In the foregoing chapters I have attempted to
give some account of a portion of that wild border
country which constitutes the Far West of China,
and most readers will perhaps agree that of all
its striking features it possesses no peculiarity so
remarkable and so puzzling as the number and
diversity of the races by which it is peopled. At a
meeting of the Royal Geographical Society in 1904
a well-known Oriental scholar, Sir George Scott,
K.C.I.E., made the remark that "the country
north of Tali-fu is the place where we shall find,
if we ever do find, the solution of a great many of
the puzzling questions of the different races who
inhabit the frontier hills." Those secluded ravines
and icy mountains have served as both the cradle
and the death-bed of nations. From that region
have issued vigorous and ambitious tribes, bent on
a career of glory and conquest; and back to it the
shattered remnants of decaying races have crept
home to die.</p>

<p>The preceding chapters may have revealed
something of the nature of the country from the
geographical point of view. Fathomless chasms,
towering cliffs and gloomy river-gorges are to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
be found throughout its length and breadth;
and we need hardly be surprised to find that the
strange variations which characterise its climate,
scenery, fauna and flora, are faithfully reproduced
in the vivid contrasts that exist among its many-tongued
peoples.</p>

<p>The comparatively short journey from Tachienlu
to Tali-fu has introduced us to some of these
peoples, but these do not by any means exhaust
the tribal varieties of this remote part of the
Chinese empire. North of Tachienlu, up to the
borders of Chinese Turkestan and Mongolia,
there are semi-independent races, some of which
are perhaps only remotely connected with any of
those mentioned in this book; while the wilder
parts of the extreme north and east of Upper
Burma and the Shan States contain further ethnological
problems of their own, which scholars have
so far indicated rather than solved.</p>

<p>Most of these tribes disclaim any connection
with each other, but it is impossible to believe
that they are all of independent origin. Probably
the scattered threads of their history will never
be gathered up until scholars have found time
and opportunity to study their social, physical
and linguistic peculiarities by prolonged residence
among them. Libraries cannot assist us much
when historical records are entirely wanting or
are obviously unreliable, and travellers who move
rapidly from place to place can do little more.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MIXTURE OF RACES</div>

<p>Professor E. H. Parker sums up his remarks
on the subject by expressing the opinion that
most of the far western tribes of China "will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
found to range themselves either under the Shan
or the Tibetan head."<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> This is probably true
enough if we give a very wide interpretation to
the word "Tibetan," and also to the word "Shan."
Our knowledge of Tibet has till recently been of
a very fragmentary nature, and the veil of mystery
that hung over that secluded land until it was
partially torn away by Lord Curzon's Lhasa
expedition, and by such enterprising travellers
as Sven Hedin, has prevented us from realising
how far the Tibetans are from being a homogeneous
race. No one who has come across the
people of eastern Tibet and has also read the
descriptions of western and central Tibet given us
by recent writers and travellers, can fail to see
that in spite of all that they possess in common
the inhabitants of Tibet are a mixed people.
"Long-heads" and "broad-heads," swarthy faces,
white faces and yellow faces, long noses and
flattened noses, oblique eyes and straight eyes,
coal-black hair and brown hair, and many other
physical peculiarities differentiate the people of
one Tibetan district from those of another, just
in the same way as they differentiate the various
races of India and Indo-China. Nearly all the
people of eastern Tibet have adopted the peculiar
form of Buddhism which as Lamaism we have
learned to associate with that country, and their
languages and customs are saturated with Tibetan
influences. In spite of many dialectical peculiarities
I found that the people of the Yalung
watershed were nearly always able to speak and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
understand Tibetan. Yet many of them are
bi-lingual, and their own languages&mdash;as may be
seen from the vocabularies in the Appendix&mdash;appear
to be nearly as distinct from Tibetan as
they are from Chinese.</p>

<p>Who are entitled to be called pure Tibetans&mdash;if
such people exist&mdash;and who should be regarded
as of hybrid or alien race, are therefore questions
not very easily determined. All the country
west of the Ta Tu river and the Chien-ch'ang
valley may rightly enough be designated Tibetan
Ssuch'uan or Chinese Tibet, if the name does not
mislead us into supposing that the natives of the
king of Chala's state, for instance, are of the same
type as the inhabitants of Lhasa. But as these
tribes are certainly not Chinese, what are we to call
them if Tibetan is, strictly speaking, a misnomer?</p>

<div class="sidenote">MAN-TZŬ</div>

<p>By the Chinese many of the western tribes
are more or less indiscriminately known as Man-tzŭ,
Man-chia, Hsi Fan and T'u Fan. Now the
words Hsi Fan and T'u Fan<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a> appear at first sight
to mean simply western Barbarians and aboriginal
(or perhaps agricultural as distinct from pastoral
or nomadic) Barbarians; but, as is now well
known,<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> the old pronunciation of the second
Chinese character in T'u Fan was not <i lang="zh">fan</i>, but
something like <i lang="zh">po</i> or <i lang="zh">p'o</i>, which is simply the
Tibetan word Bod,<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a> pronounced Bö or Beu, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
name by which the Tibetans describe their own
country and people, and from which we derive
the second syllable of our word Tibet. The
character <i lang="zh">t'u</i> was similarly a Chinese approximation
to the Tibetan word <i lang="bo">teu</i>, meaning <i>upper</i>
or <i>superior</i>.<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a> T'u Fan is then simply the Chinese
equivalent of our own word Tibetan, and means
the Bö(d) of the Uplands; and I assume that
the name <i>Turfan</i> (the oasis on the borders of
Turkestan and Sungaria, where some remarkable
discoveries have recently been made by exploring
expeditions) has the same origin, though Turfan
itself happens to lie in a very deep depression.
The combination Hsi Fan, as Mr T. W. Kingsmill
gives good reason for supposing, is in like manner
derived from the sound Shar-bar, the name of a
tribe of eastern Tibet still found near the town
of Sung-p'an in north-western Ssuch'uan.</p>

<p>The word Man-tzŭ (<span lang="cmn-Hant">蠻子</span>)<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a> is of very wide
application, and at the present time conveys the
meaning of "Savage Fellows" or "Sons of Savages,"
though it is not impossible that here too we have
a rough attempt at imitating the sound of a non-Chinese
word. When the Chinese had spread
themselves over all northern China they used this
term to describe all the uncivilised tribes whose
habitations lay to the south; just as they described<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
the "barbarians" beyond their western frontier as
Jung (<span lang="cmn-Hant">戎</span>), those beyond their northern frontier as
Ti (<span lang="cmn-Hant">狄</span>), and those of the east as I (<span lang="cmn-Hant">夷</span>). These
terms all appear again and again in the ancient
Chinese classics, such as the <i lang="zh">Shu Ching</i> and <i lang="zh">Shih
Ching</i>, and the references show that at the time
to which they refer, that is to say as far back as the
third millennium <small>B.C.</small>, the Chinese were constantly
at war with their less civilised neighbours, and by
no means met with uniform success in contending
with them. In the <i lang="zh">Shu Ching</i>, for example, we
read that "the invading barbarous tribes of the
west (Jung) have greatly injured our empire."<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a>
The <i>Man</i> tribes are in several places described as
eight in number,<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a> and we learn that in the reign of
the more or less mythical king Yu (2204-2197 <small>B.C.</small>)
their country was known as the Wild Domain,<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a>
and that Chinese criminals were transported thither
when sentenced to exile,<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a> much as the Russians
send their convicts at the present day to Siberia.
Sometimes in the Chinese classics the name <i>Man</i>
is combined with <i lang="zh">I</i> or <i lang="zh">Jung</i> as a definition of
barbarians in general,<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a> and sometimes the word
<i lang="zh">Nan</i> (South) is prefixed to make the definition
more specific. In Mencius we hear of "this
shrike-tongued barbarian of the south (<i lang="zh">Nan Man</i>),
whose doctrines are not those of the ancient
kings."<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a> Naturally enough they are often spoken
of contemptuously. "I have heard of men," says<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
Mencius, "using the doctrine of our great land
to change barbarians, but I have never yet heard
of any being changed by barbarians."<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a> Yet it is
interesting to notice that Confucius was liberal-minded
enough to admit that even a "barbarian"
might&mdash;if he were truthful and honourable&mdash;be
regarded as a gentleman.<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">MANZI AND CATHAY</div>

<p>The name Man-tzŭ clung to the inhabitants
of what is now southern China long after the
Chinese had themselves begun to spread over
that country, and no doubt many of the early
Chinese immigrants and their descendants writhed
under the derogatory epithet. About Marco Polo's
time (in the second half of the thirteenth century)
the southern portion of the empire&mdash;in fact, the
greater part of China south of the Yellow River&mdash;was
ruled by the emperors of the expiring Sung
dynasty, who, owing to the successful invasions
of the Chin Tartars, had been expelled from north
China and had created a new capital for themselves
at Hangchow (Marco's Kinsay) in the maritime
province of Chekiang. The whole of their
empire was known to the Venetian traveller as the
land of the <i lang="zh">Manzi</i> or Man-tzŭ, as distinct from
the northern (Chin-Tartar and afterwards Mongol)
empire which he calls Cathay. He has handed
down a circumstantial account of the splendour
and wealth of the so-called Manzi capital, and
he was an eye-witness of many of the stirring
episodes in that long series of campaigns which
overwhelmed the Sung imperial house and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
Shan and Lolo princes of Tien, and established the
descendants of Genghis Khan on the throne of a
united China as emperors of the Yüan or Mongol
dynasty.</p>

<p>In the Yunnanese Shan and so-called Lolo
states, which were reduced to obedience by the
Mongol prince Kúblái (afterwards emperor of
China, and known to history as Kúblái Khan), the
native tribes were too powerful and numerous to
be exterminated. Great numbers, disdaining the
Chinese yoke, migrated southward to Siam; some
of those who remained behind were allowed to
retain their tribal organisations under Chinese
suzerainty, and to a limited extent they have
retained it ever since. But in other parts of
southern China the "barbarians" were much more
harshly dealt with, for they were gradually broken
up into small bands and forced to find for themselves
a scanty subsistence in the rugged and
mountainous regions of Kuang-si, Kuei-chou and
Ssuch'uan, and multitudes seem to have fallen
back on Annam. The term Man-tzŭ, as applied
to all inhabitants of south China irrespective of
race or descent, was then gradually dropped, but
a curious instance of its survival in quite recent
times is mentioned by Professor Parker,<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a> who
found, in an official proclamation, the word used
to describe the Chinese of the Canton province.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MAN-CHIA AND MAN-TZŬ</div>

<p>Various notices of the Man-tzŭ and other hill-tribes
are to be found in the monumental work
of the historian Ssŭ-ma Ch'ien (about <small>B.C.</small> 100),
and in the later dynastic and provincial records;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
but in none of them do we find anything like a
clear statement of the history and origin of these
tribes. The fact that they were all barbarians
was sufficient, in the Chinese mind, to justify
their being left severely alone or lumped together
under some meaningless designation made applicable
to them all.<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a> At Tachienlu we come in
contact with representatives of all the various
tribes of western China and eastern Tibet, but
they are nearly all labelled either Man-chia or
Man-tzŭ. The former term means "barbarian
families," and in practice is applied to the people
whom the Chinese choose to regard as true
Tibetans as distinct from the wilder denizens of
the hills and forests. The Tibetan language is
<i lang="zh">Man-hua</i> ("the language of the barbarians"), and
the Chinese language is <i lang="zh">Han-hua</i> ("the language
of the men of Han"). The term Man-tzŭ may
now for practical purposes be restricted to certain
of the western hill-tribes to whom both Tibetan
and Chinese are foreign languages, and who preserve
distinct customs of their own in the matters
of dress, religion and social intercourse. A considerable
proportion of the people who inhabit
the scattered villages of the kingdom of Chala,
through which lay my route to the Yalung, are
Man-tzŭ, not Man-chia. M. Bonin, who has
travelled widely in western Ssuch'uan, identifies
the Man-tzŭ (using the term in the narrower
sense) with the Lolos. In common with many
other Europeans he has observed that the word
Lolo, whatever it may mean, is an opprobrious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
epithet, which is not used by the Lolos themselves
and should never be used in their presence. He
considers that the word Lolo should be dropped
altogether, and that we should substitute Man-tzŭ
as the designation of both peoples. This word, he
says, has the advantage of comprehending Mo-so,
Hsi Fan, Ku-tsung, Menia and Li-so, who are, he
considers, all of the same origin.<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a> I venture to
express a doubt whether we should gain much
by classing under one such designation a number
of peoples who, whatever their origin, have been
so long separated from one another that they
refuse to acknowledge any mutual connection,
and to some extent have different customs and
speak different languages.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">LOLOS, MAN-TZŬ AND SHAN</div>

<p>As regards the identification
of the Lolos with the Man-tzŭ, however,
there is good ground for believing that it is
justified. Probably no one has a better acquaintance
with the Lolos than the Catholic missionary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
M. Paul Vial. He has lived for many years
among the Nyi (or Ngi) Lolos of Yunnan, and
has come to the conclusion that "Man-tzŭ
et Lolos ne sont qu'une seule et même race."<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a>
His historical sketch is unfortunately too brief
to be of much value. It would appear that in
his opinion the great ruling power in Yunnan
up to the thirteenth century was not Shan but
Lolo. Indeed, his little book almost ignores the
Shans altogether, though he states that, judging
from linguistic evidence (which should always
be accepted with very great caution) the Lolos
are "brothers of the Burmese and cousins of the
T'ai"&mdash;who, of course, include the Shans. Here,
however, he seems to have gone a little astray,
as his remarks would imply a closer relationship
between Burmese and Shans than can be
proved to exist; and when he says that the Lolo
language has no relationship with the Chinese&mdash;which
seems to be true&mdash;he overlooks the fact
that the language of the Shans, whom he claims
as cousins of the Lolos, is generally recognised
as being related to Chinese.<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a> He concludes that
the Lolos, Shans and Burmese all belong to the
same stock and came originally from the unexplored
regions between the upper Mekong and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
the Brahmaputra; but he does not account for
the subsequent divergence of languages, customs
and traditions.</p>

<p>M. Vial has also some interesting notes on
a Kuei-chou tribe called the Chung-chia-tzŭ.<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a>
Their own tradition, he says, declares that they
came from the province of Kiangsi more than
eight hundred years ago, and conquered the Ke-lao.
These latter are, perhaps, Marco Polo's
Koloman or Toloman, who Yule thought might
have been a tribe of Lolos.<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a> The Chung-chia-tzŭ
are different from any of the hill-tribes
round them, and are apparently related neither
to Lolos nor to Miao-tzŭ. According to Terrien
de Lacouperie, they speak a dialect "much
resembling the Siamese, of whom they are undoubtedly
the elder brothers."<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a> If that is so,
the Chung-chia-tzŭ must be related to the Shans,
for both Shans and Siamese belong to the widely-spread
T'ai family. Mr Warry, it should be
noticed, identifies the Chung-chia-tzŭ with the
Miao-tzŭ,<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a> yet from M. Vial we learn that they
differ in manners, customs and language.<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">MIAO-TZŬ, MO-SO AND LI-SO</div>

<p>Mr F. S. A. Bourne, a first-rate authority,
classes the Miao-tzŭ by themselves, for he believes
that exclusive of the Tibetans (embracing Hsi
Fan, Ku-tsung and others) there are three great
non-Chinese races in south China: Lolo, Shan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
and Miao-tzŭ. Whatever their origin may be,
the Miao-tzŭ have succeeded in planting representatives
of their race in various widely-separated
localities. We have seen traces of them in Muli-land,
west of the Yalung,<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a> and they are also to
be found as far south as the Lao states and as
far east as Kuang-tung. They call themselves
Mung, Hmung or Hmêng, and it has been
suggested that they are an Indo-Chinese race
connected with the Môns, Peguans or Talaings.<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a>
M. Vial says that the Miao-tzŭ of Kuei-chou
believe that they came "from the East," which
is vague. In all probability no surviving race
has been settled in southern China for a longer
period than the Miao-tzŭ, and no attempt to
connect them with the surrounding races has yet
been successful.</p>

<p>As regards the Mo-so and Li-so, the people
of those tribes whom I met between Yung-ning
and Li-chiang denied there was any connection
between them, and both were strenuously opposed
to the idea that they were in any way related to
the Lolos. Such denials, however, do not go for
much, especially in the case of people who are
totally lacking in any historical sense. The Mo-so
of Yung-ning told me that they were an immigrant
race and originally came from Mongolia, but
this may be the result of confused reminiscences
of their relations with the Mongol armies between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
six and seven hundred years ago. It is a well-ascertained
fact that the Mo-so once occupied a
large portion of south-western Tibet, and indeed
there is a kind of national epic celebrating their
wars with the Tibetans. At Li-chiang, as stated
above,<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> they founded a capital which was the
centre of a powerful principality, and they still
have a prince near the Mekong river, south of
Tse-ku. At times under weak rulers they were
subject to the suzerainty of the great Shan
kingdom of Nan Chao, the capital of which was
generally at Tali-fu or not far from it; but at
other times they were practically independent of
any external control. It was not till Kúblái
brought his Mongol troops to Yunnan in order
to break up the Nan Chao kingdom as a preliminary
to the overthrow of the Sung dynasty
in south China that the political power of the
Mo-so was laid low. Kúblái, in order to avert
the possibility of being taken in the rear by
hostile tribes, turned aside from his direct march
to Tali-fu in order to reduce the Mo-so. He
captured Li-chiang and broke up the Mo-so
power about the year 1253. He subsequently
besieged and took Tali-fu. The pacification of
the newly-conquered province was entrusted by
Kúblái to his great Mongol general Uriangkadai,
and was successfully accomplished. The Mo-so,
Lolos and Shans were never again able, with any
hope of success, to defy the power of the emperor
of China.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">MO-SO</div>

<p>The origin of the word Mo-so is unknown.<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a>
They call themselves Lashi or Nashi (the <i>l</i> and <i>n</i>
being interchangeable), and the Tibetans call them
Djiung.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a> Perhaps they are the descendants of
the Jung tribes which, as stated above,<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a> are mentioned
in the Chinese classics as having frequently
menaced the western frontier of China; though
it seems more probable that the Jung were the
ancestors of the Hiung-nu. In a recent geographical
work on China<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a> the Mo-so are not
referred to with much appreciation. They are
described as deceitful and shifty, and a proverbial
saying is quoted to the effect that three Chinese
are necessary to deceive one Tibetan, and three
Tibetans to deceive one Mo-so. Most of the
eastern Mo-so speak Chinese as well as their
own language, which bears various resemblances
to Lolo. When I pointed out to some Yung-ning
Mo-so that many common words in their
language were identical with Lolo words conveying
the same meaning, they admitted the
fact but vehemently denied that it betokened
any racial affinity. This attitude may be due
to the fact that the Mo-so, once a warlike race,
have settled down quietly under Chinese rule as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
peaceful tillers of the ground, while the Lolos
have earned the reputation of being lawless freebooters.
The Mo-so resents being taken for a
Lolo, just as a sturdy Dumfriesshire farmer&mdash;whose
ancestor may have been an expert cattle-lifter&mdash;would
resent being described as the scion
of a race of highway robbers.</p>

<p>The Yung-ning district, as we have seen, still
enjoys a measure of independence under a native
prince on whom the Chinese long ago conferred
the hereditary rank of prefect.<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> The Li-chiang
district is now more directly under Chinese rule,
but even there a Mo-so official or noble acts as a
kind of assessor to the local Chinese mandarins,
who are still regarded as the representatives of a
foreign power. The Tibetan name for Li-chiang is
Sa-T'am,<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a> by which it is also known to the Mo-so.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LI-SO</div>

<p>The Mo-so under their different appellations
(including Lashi or Nashi<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a> and Djiung) are still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
a very numerous though not a homogeneous
race, and perhaps deserve a more careful study
than they have hitherto received. I am strongly
inclined to think that it is this race which constitutes
the predominant element in the population
of Muli-land or Huang Lama. We have seen
above<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a> that the people of that region call themselves
Njong, and I conjecture that this is simply
a thinly-disguised form of Djiung. The nasal
prefix is a quite frequent linguistic peculiarity
in Chinese Tibet, and occurs in many Tibetan
words. The ordinary word <i lang="bo">dro</i>, "to walk," for
instance, is almost invariably pronounced <i lang="bo">ndro</i>.<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a>
It may be allowed, however, that the people of
Muli have identified themselves more closely than
their brethren of Yunnan with the predominant
Tibetan race, and have come more directly under
Tibetan influences in respect of language and
religion. For the people of Muli-land are, as we
have seen, Buddhists of the Tibetan type, whereas
with the Mo-so of Yunnan Lamaism is only a
veneer that covers an even more uncouth system
of witchcraft and sorcery, founded on the pre-Buddhistic
Bon-pa.<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a></p>

<p>The Li-so,<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a> judging from their language only,
would appear to be rather closer to the Burmese
than to the Mo-so. In the Yung-ning district, however,
Li-so and Mo-so live together on amicable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
terms, and both express contempt or hatred for
the Lolos. The Li-so are quite as widely scattered
as the Mo-so, and may be found, apparently, in
the Shan States and the Kachin highlands as
well as in Yunnan and Ssuch'uan. They appear
to be very closely related to the La'hu of the
British Shan States, and they evidently regard
themselves as racially distinct from the Shans,
for they refuse to ally themselves in marriage with
that people.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a> The Li-so language was examined
by Prince Henry of Orleans, who found it like that
of the La'hu or Muh-sö and that of the Lolos. He
records a tradition among the Li-so that they came
originally from Nanking, on the lower Yangtse,
"which accorded with a similar tradition among the
Lolos."<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a> The Li-so of Yung-ning, when questioned
by me, gave themselves the name of Lu-su.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THEORY OF INDIAN ORIGIN</div>

<p>A very interesting contribution has quite
recently been made to the literature that bears
on the ethnology of China's Far West by the
researches of Mr T. W. Kingsmill.<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a> That scholar
presents a formidable array of evidence from Greek
as well as from Chinese sources to prove that the
<i>Sinae</i> of the fourth century of our era were the
inhabitants of <i>India extra Gangem</i>, namely the west
side of what we call the Indo-Chinese peninsula,
including Burma; that their capital, Thinae, was
on the banks of the Irrawaddy, between Bhamo and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
Mandalay;<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a> that they, "if not identical with the
widely-extended people of the Shans," had at least
a close ethnological connection with that race; that
they and kindred races sprang from the great Maurya
family of north-western India; and that to them is
due the wide prevalence of Indian political influence
and Indian art in the greater part of south-western
China as well as throughout the Indo-Chinese
peninsula and neighbouring islands. According to
this view, which certainly receives some support
from history, tradition, philology, and much miscellaneous
evidence, the Man-tzŭ were originally
of Mauryan stock, but allied themselves with the
Böd tribes or Tibetans, with whom their migrations
had brought them into close contact.<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a></p>

<p>An apparent difficulty in tracing Shans and
Man-tzŭ and other tribes to a common origin
in north-eastern India consists in the generally
recognised affinity between the Chinese and T'ai
peoples.<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a> According to the commonly-accepted
view the Shans sprang from somewhere in north-western
China and were gradually pushed southwards
as the Chinese race extended itself. De
Lacouperie considered that the cradle of the Shan
race was "in the Kiulung mountains, north of
Ssuch'uan and south of Shensi, in China proper."<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
Mr Kingsmill's theory would perhaps gain more
ready acceptance if we premised that the so-called
Indian people from whom he supposes the Man-tzŭ
and others to have sprung were themselves not
of Indian origin but had entered India at some
remote period&mdash;probably before either Aryans or
Dravidians set foot in the peninsula&mdash;either as
peaceful immigrants or as an invading host, from
the countries that lay to the north-east.<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">VESÂLI AND THE MAURYANS</div>

<p>Our knowledge of the early history of the
Maurya family is unfortunately exceedingly scanty,
and it is impossible to trace it to its pre-Indian
home. To confine ourselves to their Indian
history, the Mauryans seem to have sprung from
the Licchavis, the strongest members of the
powerful Vaggian confederation that dwelt near
the Lower Ganges, north-east of the kingdom of
Magadha. Just before the time of the Buddha&mdash;about
the seventh and sixth centuries <small>B.C.</small>&mdash;a fierce
contest for the mastery of northern India was
waged between the kingdoms of Magadha and
Kosala. This contest, as Dr Rhys Davids points
out, "was decided in the time of the Buddha's
boyhood by the final victory of Magadha."<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a> About
320 <small>B.C.</small> the Mauryan dynasty under Chandragupta
(Sandrakottos) overthrew that of Dhana Nanda and
seated itself on the throne of Magadha, which,
under a strong ruler, became more powerful than
ever. From this time onwards till the extinction of
Chandragupta's dynasty about 190 <small>B.C.</small>, the Licchavi
or Mauryan element was the main source of the
strength of Magadha, which became the supreme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
power in the Indian peninsula. The royal adventurer
Chandragupta Maurya was the contemporary and
rival of Seleukos Nikator. Chandragupta handed
on to his son Bindusāra and his grandson Asoka
(the famous Buddhist "Emperor of India") the
crown of one of the most powerful monarchies the
world had known.<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a> The capital of the Licchavis
(as distinct from the Magadhans) was the city of
Vesâli, which was probably situated about 25 miles
north of the Ganges, north-east of Pataliputra (the
modern Patna), which was the Magadhan capital.
Buddhist records give us some remarkable particulars
about Vesâli. "A triple wall encompassed
the city, each wall a league distant from the next,
and there were three gates with watch-towers. In
that city there were always 7707 kings to govern
the kingdom, and a like number of viceroys,
generals and treasurers."<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a> In another place we
are told that these numerous royal persons were
"all of them given to argument and disputation."<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a>
Allowing for Oriental exaggeration, these assertions
certainly seem to imply that Vesâli, and the people
whose capital it was, occupied a unique position
in the political system of India.<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a> There cannot
have been many cities, even in that paradise of
philosophers, which, in pre-Buddhistic days, or
indeed at any other period, harboured thousands of
disputatious kings. The so-called "kings," however,
were probably only the heads of the free<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
families. Vesâli was really the metropolis of a
number of federated republics, the influence of
which extended far beyond the boundaries of
Hindustan.</p>

<p>The Licchavis may well have pushed eastwards
into China and Indo-China long before the
Mauryans gave India its first imperial dynasty;
though if we find traces of their influence in
western China it seems not improbable that this
is due to the fact that after their migration to
India they succeeded in maintaining a friendly
intercourse with their Eastern kinsfolk. In either
case, the Licchavis (and through them the kingdom
of Magadha<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a>) must have possessed, in the days of
the struggle against Kosala, an enormous advantage
over their rivals in being able to draw an inexhaustible
supply of strength from Indo-Chinese
countries to which the Kosalans had no access.</p>

<p>I have no space here to discuss the various
arguments that Mr Kingsmill adduces to prove
that the Man-tzŭ, Lolos and allied tribes, and
perhaps the Shans, are the descendants of the
Mauryas&mdash;some being more or less mixed with
the Böd and Kiang<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a> elements of Tibet. Suffice
it to say that he traces the Maury an element in
tribal names and place-names, in decorative and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
architectural art,<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a> in Chinese records and tribal
traditions, and by an analysis of the phonetic
history of certain Chinese characters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NAN-CHAO</div>

<p>The fatal weakness of the Indo-Chinese tribes
appears at all times to have been their lack of
cohesive power. At one time it must have seemed
as though their empire would rival that of their
Indian kinsmen&mdash;if kinsmen they were&mdash;in
Magadha, and for centuries it might have seemed
a doubtful question whether they or the Chinese
were to be the masters of the vast country we
now know as China. The great kingdom of Tien&mdash;which
included the greater portions of Burma
and Yunnan&mdash;was for centuries a formidable
obstacle in the way of Chinese expansion towards
the south, and it is only within comparatively
recent years that Chinese suzerainty has been
accepted by western and southern Ssuch'uan.
The Shan kings of Tien or Nan-Chao sometimes
arrogated to themselves the title of Huang-ti
(Emperor), and frequently invaded Chinese
territory. In 859 of our era one of these
emperors besieged Ch'eng-tu, the capital of
Ssuch'uan, and left "eighty per cent. of the
inhabitants of certain towns with artificial noses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
and ears made of wood."<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a> To this day there are
thousands of square miles of nominally Chinese
territory in which Chinese law is unknown, and
with the administration of which no Chinese official
dares to meddle. Had these various tribes&mdash;many
of whom have the right, according to Mr Kingsmill's
theory, to claim a common Mauryan ancestry&mdash;produced
a few great rulers endowed with a
genius for organisation, their history might have
been at least as splendid as that of the Manchus
and the so-called Mongolians, both of which
peoples have given emperors to China. It is
indeed possible that a dynasty of Mauryan blood
did actually succeed for a few brilliant years in
seating itself on the Chinese throne, though the
evidence to this effect is far from conclusive. Mr
Kingsmill, not content with identifying the Sinae
with a people belonging to the same race as the
Mauryans, has also found reason for identifying
the Seres with the Man-tzŭ: that is to say, with
a race descended from Mauryans and Tibetans.
He conjectures that the people of the State of
Ts'in (Ch'in) were connected with "the Mans in
the south" rather than with "the Chinese in the
north." He points out that we can trace the
word Ts'in<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a> and its homologues to an ancient
pronunciation <i>Ser</i>,<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a> and that when Virgil and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
other Roman writers mentioned the <i lang="la">Seres</i> they
were making use of a name which had become
famous through the brilliant achievements of the
Ts'in or Ser, who through the genius or good
luck of Ts'in Shih Huang-ti had established a
short-lived supremacy over the other peoples of
the Chinese empire.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a> That ruler reigned from
about 221 to 209 <small>B.C.</small>, and therefore was almost
a contemporary of the great emperor Asoka, who
died only about eleven years before Ts'in Shih
Huang-ti began to reign.<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a> The famous episode
of "the burning of the books" is said to have
taken place about the year 213 <small>B.C.</small> It would
be curious if it could be proved that, during the
same century in which the great Mauryan emperor
of Magadha was trying to inaugurate a new epoch
of religion and peace by spreading the doctrines
of the Buddha throughout southern Asia, another
Mauryan ruler was sitting on the throne of China
and inaugurating what he believed to be a new era
of progress in north-eastern Asia by the destruction
of the sacred books of China.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HUNG WU'S EMPIRE</div>

<p>The Min-chia, whose characteristic features
seem to dissociate them from the Mo-so in spite
of their proximity of habitation, are probably
connected more or less closely with the Shans.
M. Vial refers to them in a passage which I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
translate as follows. "In 1394, Hung Wu,
emperor of the Ming dynasty, caused a map of
the empire to be prepared in which the Yangtse
is made to form the southern limit of China.
In 1400, Chien Wên or Hui Ti, who was Hung
Wu's successor,<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">344</a> was dispossessed by one of his
uncles and withdrew to Yunnan, where he lay
hidden for thirty years. A great number of
Chinese followed him and established themselves
there. They now form the basis of this Chinese
population that we call <i lang="zh">pên-ti-jên</i> or Min-chia.
They allied themselves to women of the indigenous
race.<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">345</a> All these <i lang="zh">pên-ti-jên</i> say that they
came from a place called Kao Shih Ch'iao of the
province of Nanking."<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">346</a> The war between Hui
Ti and his rebellious but too successful relative,
the Prince of Yen, is a matter of history; and
it is also stated in the Chinese chronicles that
when the emperor was overtaken by hopeless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
defeat he escaped to Yunnan in the garb of a
Buddhist monk. No doubt a number of faithful
followers accompanied him into exile, but I am
not aware of the evidence upon which M. Vial
relies for his statement that they are the ancestors
of the Min-chia. The Min-chia type is quite un-Chinese
in appearance. That most members of
the tribe speak Chinese is no strong argument
in favour of their Chinese descent. It is a well-known
fact that it was the deliberate policy of the
Chinese emperors&mdash;especially in the early years of
the present dynasty&mdash;to compel the conquered
people of Yunnan to learn the language of
northern China; and this policy was so wonderfully
successful that at the present day nearly
every one in Yunnan speaks a dialect which is
easily intelligible to any one who has learned
Pekingese. "The natives of Yunnan" as Baber
said "were forced to learn the language of the
north on pain of death." That a strain of pure
Chinese blood must have mingled with that of
the numerous races occupying Yunnan goes without
saying; the mere presence of large Chinese
armies on Yunnanese soil at times when campaigns
lasted for a decade or more must of itself have
tended to rub off the sharp edges of racial distinctions;
but the special characteristics of the
Min-chia are too well marked to justify the
hasty adoption of the theory that they are the
descendants of Chinese refugees from Nanking.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TRADITIONAL EASTERN ORIGIN</div>

<p>The number of different tribes who declare
that they came originally from Nanking or elsewhere
in the east is surprisingly large. I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
already<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">347</a> referred to a tradition among the Chung-chia-tzŭ
that they came from Kiangsi. The
Miao-tzŭ of Kuei-chou apparently believe that they
came "from the east." Prince Henry of Orleans
records that the La'hu and Lolos both declared
to him that they "came from Nanking ages ago,"<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">348</a>
and mentions a similar tradition among the Li-so.
That the Chung-chia-tzŭ, Miao-tzŭ, Lolo, La'hu,
Li-so and Min-chia should have all come from the
neighbourhood of Nanking seems scarcely credible,
and the tradition with regard to most of them,
if not all, may be dismissed as a fiction. But
indeed I am aware of no theory about the Min-chia,
or about Lolos, Mo-so, Li-so, Shans and
the rest, that settles all difficulties and fits in
with all the facts; and if one is tempted to
put faith in any of the numerous hypotheses
that have been advanced, it is only because a
half-truth is not always "the worst of lies," and
a permanent suspension of judgment is a source

refuge of agnosticism.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

<p class="center">TALI-FU TO BHAMO</p>


<p>At Tali-fu I found it impossible to hire mules
or coolies for a journey to the Kunlon ferry,
though during the cool weather the transport
question would have presented no difficulty. To
travel from Tali to Yün-chou, on the south of the
Mekong, would have occupied, I was told, only
seven days, and another twelve days' march would
have brought me through the valley of the Nam
Ting to the Salwen ferry at Kunlon, the boundary
of British territory. From there it is but four or
five easy stages through the jungle to the British
post of Lashio,<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">349</a> the headquarters of the Superintendent
of the North Shan States, and from that
point I could have taken train to Mandalay. In
summer, however, and especially after the commencement
of the rains, the Tali muleteers regard
a journey through the Nam T'ing valley and the
Shan jungles of the frontier as very deadly, and I
found that even an offer of treble the usual pay
would not induce a single man to come forward.
The crossing of the Salwen valley on the way
to Bhamo is also considered a very dangerous
performance in the hot season; but that, after all,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
is a matter of a few hours only, and there is no
superstitious dread of any other part of the journey.
I found it necessary, therefore, to abandon all
idea of travelling to the Kunlon ferry, and rather
reluctantly decided to take the well-known trade-route
to Bhamo, through Yung-ch'ang and T'êng-yüeh.</p>

<p>So many Europeans in recent years have
traversed this route that it is unnecessary for
me to describe, in any detail, the characteristic
features of a road which we all know so well
from the graphic accounts of such experienced
travellers as Baber, Colquhoun, Captain Gill and
Dr Morrison. South-western China bears much
the same appearance to-day as it did thirty years
ago, and it may be doubted whether it was very
different in the days of Marco Polo, though probably
the roads were better. There is therefore
very little need for me to describe this part of my
journey with any minuteness.</p>

<p>I left Tali-fu on 25th May, and passed through
the southern fortress-city of Hsia Kuan&mdash;where
the trade is much brisker than at Tali-fu itself&mdash;after
an easy ride of 6 or 7 miles. There my
road left the lake and struck west into a
ravine, and a few miles further on I reached the
village of Ho Chiang-p'u. Next day we passed
through Yang Pi, crossed a suspension bridge
which was undergoing repair, and after a fairly
stiff climb spent the night in a hamlet near
the summit of a pass. On the 27th we crossed
another pass of no great elevation, rode through
T'ai-p'ing-p'u and one or two other small hamlets,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
and descended into a deep ravine in order to
cross the Ch'ing Lien river by a suspension bridge,
which, according to an inscription, was reconstructed
in the eighteenth year of the present
reign (1892), with funds raised by the public.<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">350</a>
A few miles beyond, we halted for the night in
the village of Huang-lien-p'u. Some arduous
climbing the next day brought us to the small
town of Yung P'ing, which, a year previously, had
suffered terribly from the floods of a neighbouring
river. As no inn was habitable, I was given
accommodation in a schoolhouse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TOWARDS THE MEKONG</div>

<p>On the 29th I left Yung P'ing by a new road,
only recently opened to traffic, passed the villages
of Hsiao T'ien Pa situated amid rice-fields, Hsiao
Hua Ch'iao ("Little Flower Bridge"), and Ta Hua
Ch'iao ("Big Flower Bridge"). Above the last-named
village and overlooking it is a temple (the
San Shêng Kung), in which I lunched. In the
afternoon we climbed a steep pass from which
an equally steep descent led to the village of
Sha Yang, where we halted. Immediately on
leaving this village next day we ascended and
crossed a low ridge, and descended into a small
valley cultivated with rice. We crossed a stream
by a three-arched bridge built in 1888, called
the "Stone Bridge of the Cry of the Phœnix"
(Fêng Ming Shih Ch'iao). Beyond this is a row
of stone tablets, some commemorating the virtues
of incorruptible officials, and others recording the
names of those who had subscribed funds for
building the bridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">CROSSING THE MEKONG VALLEY</div>

<p>At the top of the next steep pass, which
overlooks the deep trough through which flows
the Mekong river (called by the Chinese the
Lan Ts'ang Chiang<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">351</a>), there is a rather large
temple much patronised and enriched by successful
traders. The descent to the river's edge is
very steep. "A series of short and dangerous
zigzags," says Baber, "leads down to a bold
suspension bridge of 60 yards span, striding the
river at its issue from the darkest of gorges.
The perpendicular walls are not 100 yards apart;
from our confined position we did not venture
to estimate their height."<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">352</a> Only the day before
my arrival a man had been killed by a boulder
which fell on his head as he was wending his
way down to the river. One of my escort
casually mentioned this to me just after we
had passed the fatal spot. The man had been
buried that morning close to the place where he
was killed. The boulder was supposed to have
been dislodged by a deer or a goat. On the
east bank of the river, close to the bridge, is
a stone tablet or shrine dedicated to the Spirit
of the Mountain, and an inscription in which
the bridge is described as the T'ai P'ing Ch'iao
("Great Peace Bridge"). The bridge is covered
by a wooden arcade, from the roof of which are suspended
several <i lang="zh">pien</i> or boards bearing appropriate
inscriptions in huge gilt letters. One of them
has the four words, <i lang="zh">Shan Kao Shui Ch'ang</i> ("The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
mountain is lofty and the river is long")&mdash;which
remark if wanting in imaginative insight at least
expresses an obvious truth concisely and to the
point. The cliffs on the west side of the river
are likewise covered with short inscriptions, carved
deeply into the rock. One of the largest of all
consists of the four words, <i lang="zh">Jên Li So T'ung</i><a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">353</a>
("Made a thoroughfare by the labour of man").
The construction of this great bridge is indeed
an engineering feat of which any people might
well be proud.</p>

<p>On leaving the river we had a stiff climb
over a fairly well paved road to P'ing P'o, the inhabitants
of which ought to be excellent mountaineers.
They cannot go out of doors in any
direction without having to ascend or descend a
steep mountain-side. A further climb of nearly
3 miles, partly beside the bed of a stream which
in the rainy season is said to be a foaming torrent
but in dry weather is absolutely non-existent,
brought us to our destination for the night in
the village of Shui Chai. In the neighbourhood
of this village I found some tombstones of
a kind I had not hitherto seen, though I met
with many similar ones thereafter. They are like
stone drums or cylinders stuck end-wise into the
ground, but slightly convex on the top. On some
of the grave-tablets are inscribed the words, <i lang="zh">Chia
Ch'êng</i> ("The City Beautiful").</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARRIVAL AT YUNG-CH'ANG</div>

<p>So far throughout my journey I had been
remarkably fortunate as regards weather. The
rainy season in western Yunnan usually begins<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
early in May, yet, except for some snow-storms,
one day's rain at Li-chiang, and two or three heavy
showers after leaving Tali-fu, I had met with
nothing but the most brilliant sunshine. I knew,
however, that once the rains began in earnest
they would continue incessantly for many weeks
to come, and for this reason I was anxious
to reach Bhamo as quickly as possible. What
became of the weather after I had reached the
Irrawaddy valley was a matter of indifference:
<i lang="fr">après moi le déluge!</i> The next stage after Shui
Chai was the city of Yung-ch'ang, and as I had
to pay off my Tali muleteers there, and engage
others to take me on to T'êng-yüeh, I sent on my
servant post-haste to Yung-ch'ang to make the
necessary arrangements in advance in order that
I might not have to waste a day. Following
him more leisurely, I left Shui Chai and rode
along a winding road for about 6 miles to the
summit of a pass from which we had a good view
of a portion of the Yung-ch'ang plain. This
range of hills separates the watershed of the
Mekong from that of the much-dreaded Salwen.
Soon after crossing the pass our road led us down
the left side of a small mountain stream, and
it was interesting to reflect that its waters were
destined, like myself, for British territory. The
first village on the west side of the pass was Niu
Chio Kuan. It consisted of two huts in Baber's
time, and though it has since then quintupled
in size it is by no means an imposing centre of
population. A mile further down the slope we
reached Kuan P'o, a larger village, whence we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
descended to the edge of the Yung-ch'ang plain,
and passed by the side of the village of Shih
K'o Ts'un, which possesses a rather handsome
and imposing temple, the Kuang Tsun Ssŭ.<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">354</a> I
may note here that as one enters western Yunnan
a tendency to over-decoration and ornateness
in the architecture of temples is observable, but
on the whole the effect is generally rather
pleasing than otherwise, as carved and decorated
doorways and fantastic gables often relieve the
sordid meanness of the village dwelling-houses.
No doubt the influence of non-Chinese races,
akin to the Burmese or Shans, has been at
work here.</p>

<p>The next village was Pan Ch'iao, a prosperous-looking
place with a street of shops and many
new buildings and ferocious dogs. One of the
dogs, however, came to sorry grief in a conflict
with my own bull-terrier, which&mdash;I will say it to
his credit&mdash;seldom took the trouble to fight unless
his antagonists were at least two in number. On
leaving this village we were in full view of Yung-ch'ang
city, with its curious pyramidal hill in
the background. We entered by the north gate
early in the afternoon. Within the city it almost
seemed as though we were still traversing country
roads, for we passed many wide open spaces,
cultivated plots and a few isolated cottages, and
the prickly pear was flourishing where one might
have expected to find shops and paved streets.
However, the whole city did not present this
forlorn appearance, for a turning to the right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
brought us to a busy and populous quarter, and
a further turn to the left led us into a lane in
which inns abounded, showing that the city
fostered a certain amount of trade.</p>

<p>I expected to find a fair assortment of foreign
articles for sale here, but there were few. Tinned
pineapples from a Chinese firm in Singapore,
bearing a distinguished-looking label with the
Royal Arms and the British lion, were to be
bought for the equivalent of ninepence a tin; and
"Finest Mineral Wax Candles, specially made
for India," and sold by a well-known Rangoon
firm, were also to be had for about one shilling
per packet of five.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COUVADE</div>

<p>We have seen that the district of which
Tali-fu is the centre, is the Carajan of Marco
Polo. Its western limit appears to have been
the Mekong river, and west of that was the old
kingdom or state which Marco calls the Province
of Zardandan. To its capital he gives the name
of Vochan, and this city has been identified with
Yung-ch'ang. This is the "Golden-Teeth"
country, so named because the inhabitants were
said to cover their teeth with thin movable plates
of gold. Of this custom no vestige remains, and
it is uncertain whether the people are represented
by Shans or by some race connected with the
Kachins. The inhabitants of the district were
evidently regarded by the Chinese till quite
modern times as an inferior race, for there is
in the Chinese Penal Code a law to the effect
that immigrant Chinese, visiting Yung-ch'ang for
purposes of trade, must not ally themselves by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
marriage with the "outer barbarians" of that
neighbourhood. The extraordinary practice known
to us by the name (popularised by Tylor) of
<i>Couvade</i> apparently existed in Yung-ch'ang
in Marco Polo's time; and as he was doubtless
unaware of its prevalence in many other parts
of the world his testimony on the subject may
be regarded as trustworthy. "And when one
of their wives," says Marco, "has been delivered
of a child, the infant is washed and swathed,
and then the woman gets up and goes about
her household affairs, whilst the husband takes
to bed with the child by his side, and so keeps
his bed for forty days; and all the kith and
kin come to visit him, and keep up a great
festivity. They do this because, say they, the
woman has had a hard bout of it, and 'tis but
fair the man should have his share of suffering."<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">355</a>
Whether this explanation of the custom is the
true one is perhaps open to doubt. It is hardly
flattering to the kith and kin, who presumably
did their best to relieve the man's monotony,
and make matters as pleasant as the somewhat
singular circumstances permitted.</p>

<p>The annals of Yung-ch'ang should prove of
exceptional interest to the student of Chinese
history, for they cannot but throw a flood of
light on the relations between the various tribes
and states that have striven for the mastery of
western Yunnan and the great valleys of the
Mekong and Salwen. Its first annexation to
the Chinese empire may be assigned to the year<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
1277, when a great battle&mdash;vividly described by
Marco Polo<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">356</a>&mdash;was fought in the Yung-ch'ang
plain between the army of the Great Khan and
the ambitious king of Mien, or Burma, the main
strength of whose army consisted in a host of
elephants. "Then might you see swashing blows
dealt and taken from sword and mace; then might
you see knights and horses and men-at-arms go
down; then might you see arms and hands and
legs and heads hewn off: and besides the dead
that fell, many a wounded man, that never rose
again, for the sore press there was. The din and
uproar were so great from this side and from that,
that God might have thundered and no man would
have heard it! Great was the medley, and dire
and parlous was the fight that was fought on both
sides; but the Tartars had the best of it."</p>

<p>The population of Yung-ch'ang is still a very
mixed one, but the Chinese language is spoken
and understood by all classes, and the dialect
differs little from that of the metropolitan province.
The observant Marco Polo noticed among the
people of Zardandan the prevalence of the custom
of tatooing the body and legs: a custom which
to this day is universal among the Shans and
Burmese and allied races.</p>

<div class="sidenote">IN THE LION'S DEN</div>

<p>On arrival at my inn I found that all arrangements
for the next stage of my journey had been
duly made, and on the following morning I set
out with two new riding mules&mdash;one for myself
and one for my servant&mdash;and two baggage mules.
The muleteers undertook to get us to T'êng-yüeh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
in five days, and kept their word. Our road led
through the city past a temple dedicated to the
God of Wealth and out of the south gate. I
noticed the date "Kuang Hsü xxvi" (1900) on
some of the bricks of the city wall, showing that
a restoration had taken place recently. Unfortunately
the authorities take no steps to prevent weeds
and shrubs from growing in the interstices and on
the parapet, and the roots must in course of time
seriously affect the stability of the structure. Outside
the gate we passed a Kuan Yin temple and
went through a small suburb. The road then lay
for about 4 miles southward over the plain and
through the village of Wo Shih Wo (the "Sleeping
Lion's Den"). The name is derived from a cave
a few hundred yards above the village. The smell
of the innumerable bats, not to mention the disquieting
possibility of arousing the lion from his
slumbers, would make the cave a disagreeable
place to explore. The cave evidently penetrates
some distance into the hill, though from the
entrance it is difficult to say how far, as there
is a turn to the left. It was very dark, and I
did not venture far into the interior, as there
was a steep slope made slippery by the constant
dripping of water from the roof. The descent
would have been easy enough&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sed revocare gradum superasque evadere ad auras<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hoc opus, hic labor est,"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>so I left the attempt to the next traveller.</p>

<p>From here the road wound steadily but
not steeply up and over a range of hills, and
brought us to the village of Hao Tzŭ P'u. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
continued the ascent to the summit of a pass, and
in the course of the corresponding descent reached
the village of Lêng Shui Ching ("Cold Water
Well"). Another 5 or 6 miles brought us down
to a level plain and to our halting-place&mdash;the
large village of P'u Piao. Here I found the
accommodation bad, though it is a regular stage
and there are several inns.</p>

<p>The next stage was a very short one, only
about 7 miles, but it brought us to the edge of
the "Valley of the Shadow of Death"&mdash;the chasm
through which flows the Salwen&mdash;and my men
would not dare to cross it unless they were quite
fresh and had dosed themselves well with quinine.
The road from P'u Piao offers no difficulties. The
only villages we passed were several which bore
the collective name of Fang Ma Ch'ang. Baber
describes this place as being a ruined hamlet, but
it has risen from its ashes since his day. Even
as late as Baber's time this district was the scene
of sanguinary strife between the imperial forces
and a noted rebel chief. Baber actually saw the
rebel camp on the hills opposite the road in the
Fang Ma Ch'ang valley. No wonder he passed
villages in ruins. Two miles further brought us
to the end of our short stage&mdash;the miserable
hamlet of Ta Pan Ching. A short distance behind
it, on the slope of a wooded hill, is a small rock-temple.
In it there are four sedent figures and two
standing. A semicircular brick wall is built in
front of them, so that their view, if they had
eyes to see, would be distinctly circumscribed and
lacking in variety. Just above the shrine, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
nearly hidden by trees, is a picturesque little
temple, and close by are a few graves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH"</div>

<p>Next morning, after dosing my men and myself
with all the quinine that was likely to be good
for us, I began the long winding descent into
the valley of the Salwen, the Chinese name for
which is the Lu Chiang or Lu Tzŭ Chiang.<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">357</a> I
started on foot half an hour before my men,
and did not see them until we all foregathered
at the river. Soon after starting I came upon a
stream of running water by the side of which
was a tablet bearing a Chinese inscription to the
effect that the water was dangerous to drink.
Is it possible that the streams of this valley really
contain some vegetable or mineral poison, and
that it is from this fact that the valley derives
its terrible reputation? The height of Ta Pan
Ching above sea-level is 4,500 feet, while the
bed of the Salwen lies at about 2,400; the
actual descent was therefore 2,100 feet. It is
not very steep, for the Salwen valley at this
point is very much broader than that of the
Mekong in the same latitude. After an easy
and pleasant walk I reached the suspension bridge
feeling quite as free from sickness as when I
started.</p>

<p>I can offer no plausible theory to account for
the traditional unhealthiness of the Salwen valley.
To all appearance its verdant hills and broad slopes
ought to be covered with cultivation and with the
homes of thousands of industrious farmers. As it
is, not a soul lives in the whole of that splendid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
stretch of country except a few despised Shan
or Pa I tribesmen, who are apparently the only
people who can dwell there and thrive. Most
travellers dash across as if they were flying for
their lives,<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">358</a> and consider themselves fortunate
if they are not struck down before they reach
the heights overlooking the further side of the
valley. Baber's account of its terrors, as they
were described to him, is well worth quoting.
"The morrow's journey would lead us across the
Salwen&mdash;a river, to the native mind, teeming
with portent and mystery. In western Yunnan
this river is always spoken of with a certain awe.
Governor Ts'ên himself had warned us to cross
its valley with all haste. Often had we been told
of the many varieties of malarious exhalations
which shroud the hollow after sunrise: fogs,
red, yellow and blue, of which the red is the
most deadly and the blue next in the scale of
mortality. General Thunder, who had never
previously crossed, came to notify to us that he
had determined to start before daylight, so as
to get well beyond the river before the sun was
up. Luckily for us, he said, the deadly flood
was now spanned by a suspension bridge, but
before its construction travellers had to pass
in boats. In those days a gruesome monster,
resembling in shape a huge blanket, would issue
from the depths, and, wrapping passengers and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
boat in his fœtid folds, would sink back into
his native abyss."<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">359</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SALWEN VALLEY</div>

<p>How far back these superstitions may be
traced is difficult to say. Certainly in Marco
Polo's time, in the thirteenth century, they were
widely current; for, though he himself obviously
did not cross the valley, he describes the whole
region as "full of great woods and mountains
which 'tis impossible to pass, the air in summer
is so impure and bad; and any foreigners attempting
it would die for certain." That travellers
descending from the high Yunnan plateau into
a steamy valley only 2,400 feet above sea-level
may be seriously inconvenienced by the sudden
change of temperature,<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">360</a> and perhaps become liable
to attacks of fever, is not improbable; but as
none of my own party succumbed to sickness,
I am inclined to think that the Salwen has been
unjustly maligned. My friend the Peking <cite>Times</cite>
correspondent has told us "there can be little
doubt that the deadliness of the valley is a
tradition rather than a reality." In view of Dr
Morrison's well-known accuracy, I am content
to accept his opinion as the true one, more
especially as it coincides with my own. Being a
man of scientific and medical skill he would surely
have sought out and annihilated Baber's blanket-fiend
if it had existed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span></p>

<p>After crossing the suspension bridge, which is
similar in construction to those already noticed
but is in two sections, I came to a small Pa I
hamlet and a temple. Being in no hurry, and
anxious to give the noxious vapours of the valley
every opportunity of doing their worst on me,
I paid a long visit to the temple and waited
about an hour for the arrival of my caravan. I
was told that the indigenous inhabitants of the
valley were gradually increasing in numbers and
bringing more of the land under cultivation, and
that they were ruled by a <i lang="zh">t'u ssŭ</i> or tribal chief
who dwelt on the right bank of the river at a
place about 10 miles to the south. A path leads
thither along the river-bank.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RAINBOW IN THE SALWEN VALLEY</div>

<p>The upward climb on the west side of the
valley was not arduous, and the mules made the
ascent without much difficulty in spite of the fact
that a very heavy shower of rain turned the
road into a running stream. It was curious to
watch the rain-storm in the shape of a dense
grey cloud rushing southwards through the valley.
On looking back towards the river, then a couple
of thousand feet below us, we had a fine view
of the silver waters of the Salwen sparkling in
brilliant sunshine; in a moment they were hidden
by a rolling mass of dark vapour, out of which
arose a strange parti-coloured rainbow in which
orange and blue-green predominated. Its perfect
arch crossed the whole breadth of the river-bed
where the valley was narrowest, spanning the
river like a fairy bridge. In five minutes the
storm rolled on and the rainbow faded away,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
leaving me with the impression that I had
never seen anything more beautiful or more
strange. The fancy occurred to me that it was
perhaps some such natural phenomenon as this
that gave rise to the tradition recorded by
Baber about the tinted fogs that varied in
deadliness according to their colour.</p>

<p>We were all in a very wet and draggled
condition when we arrived at the wretched
wattle-and-mud hamlet of Hu Mu Shu, after
a climb of about 3,100 feet above the level of
the river. When we started next morning it
was still raining, and in half an hour the clothes
that we had dried with difficulty were again
wet through. Our path lay to a great extent
through thick forest, and the dripping of the
leaves was almost as troublesome as the rain
itself. We had a steady climb of about 3 miles
to the hamlet called Hsiang Po ("Elephant's
Neck"), and a further climb of 1,500 feet to the
summit of a pass 8,730 feet high. There is a
wooden gateway at the top. From here the
road descends for about a mile, then ascends
again and undulates, and finally goes rather
steeply down to the hamlet of T'ai P'ing,
where we halted for our midday rest. Pheasants
abound in this district, but the jungle is so
thick that it is hardly possible to leave the
pathway in search of game. Our host at T'ai
P'ing possessed some valuable European articles
in the shape of a glass oil-lamp and two empty
claret bottles probably left behind by some
traveller more amply provided than myself with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
good things. The descent to the Shweli or
Lung River was a steep and slippery ride in the
course of which we descended about 3,500 feet.
The river is crossed by a suspension bridge of
the usual type. A mile or two further on we
came to the village of Kan-lan-chan, where we
spent the night in a very dirty inn.</p>

<p>Next day's stage presented no features of
special interest. Early in the afternoon I
descended to the T'êng-yüeh plain, which is
studded with more or less prosperous villages,
and soon caught sight of the semi-European
buildings of the Chinese Imperial Customs and&mdash;more
welcome still&mdash;the Union Jack floating
over the gates of the British Consulate. There I
was most hospitably received and entertained by
Mr Ottewell, Acting British Consul, and enjoyed
a two days' rest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PROJECTED RAILWAYS FROM BURMA</div>

<p>T'êng-yüeh is to be the terminus of the proposed
British railway from Bhamo, regarding which
negotiations have been in progress for some considerable
time. That the trade between Burma
and China by this route requires some stimulus
is unquestionable. The officials in charge of the
T'êng-yüeh Customs informed me that the volume
of trade annually passing through their hands was
not showing any elasticity, and that the Customs
revenue barely served to defray the expenses of the
establishment. Whether the railway will stimulate
the trade to any very great extent is questionable;
for caravans bound for Burma have already
surmounted all serious obstacles, in the shape of
mountain and flood, by the time they have reached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
T'êng-yüeh, so that as far as they are concerned
a railway would merely shorten by a few days a
journey which already might have lasted months.
Local traffic between the two termini will probably
be found fairly remunerative, though very large
returns can hardly be expected. If the railway
could be carried on to Tali-fu, its ultimate success
would be a certainty; but the engineering difficulties
are very great, and the amount of capital
required for construction would be enormous.
From Tali-fu several branch lines might be constructed,
one going south to the Kunlon ferry (a
route which has already been surveyed) to meet
the existing British line from Mandalay to Lashio,
and another going north to Li-chiang. The main
line should, of course, be carried eastwards to
Yunnan-fu, which will very soon be in railway
communication with French Indo-China and the
port of Haiphong. The branch line from Tali-fu to
Li-chiang&mdash;following the route traversed by myself<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">361</a>&mdash;would
meet with no great difficulties, and would
pass through a series of rich and populous valleys.
Even if Li-chiang were a terminus it is probable
that the local traffic would amply justify such a
railway; though it would be better still if further
branches could be carried on to Wei-hsi in the
west, in order to intercept the Tibetan trade, and
to Hui-li-chou or Ning-yüan-fu on the east, to tap
the trade of the Chien-ch'ang valley, which might
eventually include a great deal of the foreign trade
of Ssuch'uan. It must be admitted that all these
lines&mdash;with the exception of the branch from Tali<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
to Li-chiang&mdash;would be very costly to construct
and to keep in repair. Meanwhile British enterprise
seems content to restrict itself to the short
line between Bhamo and T'êng-yüeh. This railway
will doubtless fully justify its existence, but
it is absurd to suppose that such a line will seriously
compete with the French lines in the east of the
province, or will have any appreciable effect in
deflecting the trade of Yunnan from Tongking to
Burma.<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">362</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CHINESE SHAN STATES</div>

<p>At T'êng-yüeh I paid off the Tibetan servant
who had accompanied me from Tachienlu, and the
muleteers who had come from Yung-ch'ang, and
engaged new mules and coolies to take me to
Bhamo. I resumed my journey on 8th June.
The path soon leaves the plain and mounts
through extensive graveyards and over barren
hills. Later in the day we descended, gradually
but steadily, to a valley, narrow, but very extensively
cultivated with rice and dotted with many
villages. In many cases the recent rains had
caused the inundated rice-fields to overflow into
the road, which was often quite submerged. I
lunched at the small village of Jê Shui T'ang,
which, as its name implies, possesses a natural hot
spring. We had now left the Yunnan plateau
behind us, and had descended to the plains that
slope gradually downwards towards the Irrawaddy.
For the rest of the way to Burma I found that
the vast majority of the population were Shans and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
Kachins, whose picturesque dresses are a pleasant
contrast to the drab-coloured garments that
generally content the less æsthetic Chinese. The
women are remarkable for their headgear, which
is similar to that worn by the isolated Shans whom
I had seen in the Salwen valley. It consists of a
tall dark turban that looks like a kind of antediluvian
gentleman's top-hat that has been cruelly
sat upon. Unfortunately the Shans, both men
and women, are much given to disfiguring their
mouths by chewing betel-nut&mdash;a disagreeable habit
of an otherwise charming people. The drinking-water
in this part of the country&mdash;as is generally
the case in a land of padi-fields&mdash;must be used
with great caution. I passed a clear flowing
stream, by the side of which was the notification,
<i lang="zh">t'zŭ shui yu tu</i> ("This water is poisonous")&mdash;a
warning which must be disconcerting to a
thirsty wayfarer.</p>

<p>We spent the night of our first day from
T'êng-yüeh in a roomy temple in the large village
of Nan Tien. The next day was uneventful. We
traversed execrable roads. Often it was difficult
to know whether we were on the path or in a
padi-field, for both were inundated, and we spent
the greater part of the day in wading through
a series of shallow and very muddy lakes. We
spent the second night in the market village
of Kau Ngai, and the third in Hsiao Hsin Kai
("Little Bhamo"). The purely Shan villages
were generally enclosed within fences, and we did
not see much of them; but I noticed that the
native houses in the Chinese Shan States are less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
picturesque, and also apparently less clean and
commodious than those of the Lao-Shans in the
French Shan States and Siam. On 11th June
the swollen rivers caused us even greater trouble
than the flooded rice-fields, and at one point I
feared we should have to wait till the waters
subsided. Between the villages of Hsiao Hsin
Kai and Lung Chang Kai we came to a river
which, though doubtless an insignificant brook in
dry weather, was then a swift and muddy river
about 60 yards broad. There was nothing in the
way of boat, bridge or ford, and our mules, with
all the obstinacy of their kind, for a long time
refused to leave the bank. Finally, my two
baggage animals were relieved of their burdens,
which were carried across in separate light loads
on the heads of coolies. The latter were stripped
to the skin, for the water was almost high enough
to take them off their feet. One of them lost
his footing, and let his load fall into the water; it
was recovered, but most unfortunately it contained
some rolls of exposed photographic films. The
comparatively poor results of my journey from
the photographic point of view&mdash;for dozens of
films were utterly ruined&mdash;are largely due to that
unhappy accident. The fact that I had so nearly
reached my journey's end and had so far escaped
any such mishap rendered it all the more vexatious.
I crossed the river without any disaster to myself,
but the drenching to which I was unavoidably
subjected gave me an attack of fever, which
was not shaken off for several days. It is not so
easy to get rid of colds and fevers in the steamy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
tropical valleys of the Shan States as it is in the
exhilarating climate of the Tibetan mountains.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BRITISH-MADE ROAD IN CHINA</div>

<p>The latter part of the same day's journey (the
fourth stage from T'êng-yüeh) was unexpectedly
easy. I suddenly found myself on a good broad
road, unmetalled, but well engineered. I followed
this road the whole way to Bhamo, and it was not
until my arrival there that I was given an explanation
of so unusual a phenomenon as a carriage
road in Chinese territory. It was the work of
British engineers, and had been undertaken by
the Government of Burma at the request and at
the expense of the Government of Yunnan. The
provincial funds have not yet permitted of the
extension of the road to T'êng-yüeh, but it is to
be hoped, for the sake of future travellers, and
in the interests of trade, that something will be
done to carry it over the rain-sodden plains.
When we struck the British-made road we were
about 70 or 80 miles from Bhamo, and between
20 and 30 from the British frontier. At 15 miles
from the frontier we halted for the night in the
village of Man-hsien, which is the administrative
centre of a Chinese-Shan chief or sawbwa.<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">363</a> It is
only a hamlet consisting of about thirty flimsy
bamboo huts, several of which were shops for
the sale of local produce.</p>

<p>On 12th June my day's journey began in
Chinese and ended in British territory. Being
too impatient to wait for my muleteers&mdash;who
showed no emotion at the proximity of the British<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
flag&mdash;I started on foot and walked the whole of
the 15 miles to the frontier. There was a heavy
shower in the early morning, but the sky soon
cleared up, and for the rest of the day the
fierce rays of a tropical sun beat upon me with
all their strength, and taxed all the resisting
power of the shilling umbrella I had bought at
San Ying. The gradient of the road was excellent
throughout, but being unmetalled it had been
much damaged by the recent rains. In many
places it was entirely blocked by landslips; at
others it had been torn away by mountain floods.
It was bordered by dense jungle on both sides.
On the left, luxuriant vegetation covered the
steep slope of a mountain; on the right was an
abrupt descent into a ravine, in which one could
hear but seldom see the roaring torrent below.
In some places the landslips had brought down
large trees, which lay across the road. My mules,
I heard afterwards, had great difficulty in surmounting
these various obstacles, and in some
cases were forced to trample out a new road for
themselves in the jungle. The road, good as it
was, seemed to me a "fair-weather" road. There
was a lack of bridges. Streams that might be
non-existent in the dry season were then rushing
over the road, wearing deep channels in its surface,
or tearing it away altogether. There was also a
lack of storm-water drains. These would at least
do a little to prevent the torrential summer rains
from making havoc of the roadway. Further,
the wooded slopes adjacent to the road have not
been sufficiently strengthened, and, under present
conditions, serious landslips are bound to occur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
every year. Only an engineer has any right to
speak with authority on such matters, but one
may perhaps hazard the suggestion that the
cemented roads of Hongkong, with their admirable
and elaborate storm-drainage system, might
with advantage be copied in Upper Burma in
places where the roads are specially liable to landslips
or floods. Probably, however, the great
cost of such roadways would be prohibitive in
a country which is, after all, thinly populated,
and where there is little traffic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BRITISH FRONTIER</div>

<p>In referring to the lack of bridges I must
not forget the admirable iron bridge at Kamsa,
4 miles west of Man-hsien in Chinese territory.
It spans a torrent which descends in a series of
dazzling cascades. The highest of these, visible
from the bridge, is a really fine waterfall, which
would attract crowds of sightseers if it were in
a more accessible country. The bridge is quite
new, having been completed only in April 1905.
Had it not existed, I should have found myself
in a serious dilemma. The stream that flowed
below it was a boiling torrent which neither man
nor horse could ford or swim, and its course,
above and below, was hidden by impenetrable
jungle.</p>

<p>At the bottom of a narrow ravine 15 miles
from Man-hsien there is a brook spanned by a
log of wood. I saw no inscribed pillar, and no
flags, nor was I challenged by any lynx-eyed
Indian sentry; but this is the spot at which two
great Empires meet. On the Chinese side were
a few Shan huts, known collectively as Kulika.
After climbing out of the ravine on the western<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
side, I found the first evidence of British occupation:
two small wooden bungalows surrounded
by servants' sheds and outhouses. They were all
empty and deserted, though some Shan pedlars
were peacefully enjoying their midday slumber
on one of the verandahs. The bungalows had
probably been used by engineers and surveyors,
but evidently they had not been occupied for
some time. I took temporary possession of the
one not selected by the Shans, and awaited there
the arrival of my caravan.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RETURN TO CIVILISATION</div>

<p>After a meagre tiffin I again set off on foot
amid enchanting tropical scenery. The views
were not extensive, for the road lay through a
gorge covered with thick jungle. Several hundred
feet below the road I occasionally caught sight
of the foaming waters of the T'ai P'ing rushing
tempestuously through its confined bed. From
a wide, majestic and apparently navigable river&mdash;for
such it was while it flowed through the plains
I had lately been traversing&mdash;it had become a
series of boiling rapids noisily protesting against
their confinement within so narrow a channel.
Eight miles beyond the frontier I was not sorry
to come within sight of the end of my long day's
walk&mdash;the first of the trim little Public Works
Bungalows<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">364</a> which a considerate Government has
established at convenient distances along the main
roads of Upper Burma for the use of officials and
travellers. Here I was welcomed by a Kachin
damsel, who, in the absence of the regular bungalow
keeper, addressed to me soothing words
which, I felt sure, must be meant to be words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
of welcome; and I made haste to interpret them
as such. A walk of 23 miles at the hottest season
of the year in a tropical country is not a task
to be lightly undertaken every day; and when
allowance is made for the manner in which I
had lived for the past few months, in a country
where European comforts are unknown, I may
perhaps be pardoned for having given way to
feelings of exultation at finding myself in a
bungalow furnished&mdash;as it seemed to me&mdash;with
the utmost luxury. A clean table-cloth, knives
and forks and glass tumblers, long easy-chairs,
a four-poster bed with mosquito curtains, and,
above all, a bath, were things of beauty and
wonder that seemed almost too good to be true.</p>

<p>My expedition from Weihaiwei to the frontier
of Burma had occupied five months and six days.
I had travelled from the most easterly prefecture
in China (Têng-chou) to the most westerly
(Yung-ch'ang); from the extreme north-east to
the extreme south-west of China; over the loftiest
passes in the empire, and through seven of its
provinces. I had also traversed most of China's
greatest rivers-the Yellow River, Yangtse, Min,
Ya, Ta Tu, Yalung, Mekong, Salwen and Shweli.
As to my condition at the end of this long and
solitary journey, during the greater part of which
I had partaken of the same coarse and frugal
fare as my coolies and muleteers, I need only say
that apart from a short attack of fever in the
Shan plains beyond T'êng-yüeh I never had a
day's sickness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BRITISH-INDIAN TROOPS</div>

<p>At the bungalow of Mong-kung-ka I was
still some distance from Bhamo. At the earnest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
request of my guides, whose mules were
exhausted, I spent three days in traversing the
remaining 43 miles. On 13th June I halted
at the bungalow of Kulong-ka, 30 miles from
Bhamo. Next day, at the eighteenth milestone
from Bhamo, I found myself on a metalled
carriage road, as good as a first-rate country
road in England, and followed it to the bungalow
at Momauk, a small village inhabited by Shans
and Kachins. On the 15th I left Momauk
before 6 <small>A.M.</small>, hoping to reach the travellers'
Dâk bungalow at Bhamo, only 9 miles distant,
without having to meet the critical eyes of the
European residents. The very slender outfit
with which I had started from Weihaiwei had
long since disappeared. Peking furs and sheep-skin
boots had served me well on the Tibetan
mountains, but were hardly suitable for a
tropical climate: and what remained of them
I had given away to my followers at Tali-fu.
Other garments had gradually fallen to pieces,
and had been discarded one by one. I was now
wearing Chinese straw sandals without socks, an
old khaki suit patched with most inappropriate
coarse blue cloth, and held together with string
instead of buttons, and a huge, wide-flapping
straw hat such as forms the headgear of Chinese
Shans when working in the fields. The animal
on which I had ridden from T'êng-yüeh was
a shaggy Yunnanese pony. The saddle, which
I had bought in Tachienlu, was of the kind
generally used by the natives of eastern Tibet,
with a high pommel tipped with metal, and a
hard wooden seat covered with tightly-stretched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
yak leather. The stirrups were iron plates something
like flat saucers, and the bridle was of
rope and twisted bamboo. I had no desire to be
thrust into the deputy-commissioner's dungeons
on suspicion of being a head-hunting Wa, or an
untamed Kachin, yet it was rash to expect any
more hospitable reception in my present condition.
My hopes of evading detection until
I had emerged a new man from the shops of
the shoemakers and tailors of Bhamo were
doomed to disappointment. I covered the nine
miles at my pony's quickest trot, and the houses
of Bhamo were already in sight, when suddenly
arose in front of me an ominous cloud of dust.
A glint of sunshine shone on a brilliant array
of polished arms, and quickly out of the dust
advanced a body of Indian troops. The pleasure
with which I should have welcomed the sight
of a British mountain-battery and the sound
of the tramp of the king-emperor's soldiers was
damped by my painful knowledge of the ridiculous
figure I must have presented. I hastily urged
my pony into a friendly ditch while the detachment
passed by, but I could not, unfortunately,
escape the "stony British stare" of the commanding-officer.
Half a mile further on, on entering
the town, I met a solitary European on horseback,
who in answer to my timid query kindly
directed me to the Dâk bungalow. Half an
hour afterwards I was arraying myself in ready made
garments of varying degrees of misfit in
that admirable establishment well known to all
residents in Upper Burma as "Kohn's."</p>

<p class="center">BHAMO TO MANDALAY</p>


<div class="sidenote">BHAMO</div>

<p>A few years ago Bhamo was regarded by
Europeans as far out of the reach of the
ordinary traveller, and beyond the uttermost
limits of what to the complacent Western mind
constitutes civilisation. Since our soldiers took
"the road to Mandalay" and ended an almost
bloodless campaign in 1885<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">365</a> by annexing Upper
Burma and deporting its misguided monarch,
the little north-eastern frontier-town of Bhamo
has entered upon a new phase of its somewhat
dramatic history. It is now a considerable
<i>entrepôt</i> of trade, and is bound to derive the full
benefit of any future increase of overland commerce
between China and Burma. It is therefore
full of representatives of all the races of
south-eastern Asia who meet there to exchange
their varied goods. There is also a garrison,
generally consisting of Indian troops, but sometimes
of a British regiment as well; and their
duty it is not only to watch the Chinese frontier&mdash;an
easy task nowadays&mdash;but also to keep an
eye on the wild Kachins and other lawless tribes
of north-eastern Burma where there is still a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
vast tract of country "unadministered"&mdash;that
is not yet brought under the direct control
of the British Government. There is therefore
a considerable English colony consisting of
officers of the army and of the military police
and a few civil officials. Of the latter, the
chief is the deputy-commissioner. Like all
members of the great service to which he belongs,
he is a man who plays many parts and fulfils
many functions. He it is who, in the eyes of
the subject peoples, represents the imperial power
of Great Britain. The "uncovenanted" service is
represented by officers of the Public Works and
Forestry, and other departments of government.
That Bhamo is no longer a barbarous place outside
the pale of civilisation is finally proved by
the fact that it is now the residence of several
English ladies who apparently find life not only
supportable but even pleasant.</p>

<p>"There is a wonderful mixture of types in
Bhamo. Nowhere in the world ... is there a
greater intermingling of races. Here live in
cheerful promiscuity Britishers and Chinese, Shans
and Kachins, Sikhs and Madrasis, Punjabis, Arabs,
German Jews and French adventurers, American
missionaries, and Japanese ladies." Such is the
concise summing-up of Dr Morrison; and I may
add that I found Bhamo much the same as it was
when he visited it in 1894 except that the French
adventurers and the Japanese ladies appeared to
have fled to other pastures. But in another of his
remarks I must confess I am unable to concur.
"At its best," he says, "Bhamo is a forlorn,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
miserable and wretched station, where all men
seem to regard it as their first duty to the stranger
to apologise to him for being there." No such
apologies were made to me; and if they had, I
should have suspected that the apologist was taking
an unnecessarily gloomy view of his surroundings.
There are certainly many worse places in the East
than Bhamo. It is within easy reach of Mandalay
and Rangoon by steamer and train, and is therefore
by no means so isolated as its position on the map
might lead one to suppose. Its neighbourhood is
picturesque; it has clubs and lawn-tennis courts;
roads are good; there are many open spaces suitable
for polo and the other games that the exiled
Englishman loves, and its European houses are
roomy bungalows surrounded by delightful gardens
full of the glories of tropical vegetation. For part
of the year the climate is no doubt trying. The
town lies on the banks of the Irrawaddy, and is less
than 400 feet above the sea-level. Before the rains
break in early summer the temperature sometimes
goes up to 100° Fahr. It was over 90° in the shade
during the few days that I resided there. But that
is cool compared with Mandalay, where the heat, at
the end of the dry season, is sometimes excessive.
I was told in Bhamo that the temperature at
Mandalay about three weeks earlier was no less
than 115° in the shade in the afternoon. But the
dryness of the atmosphere both at Bhamo and
Mandalay during the spring and early summer
saves European constitutions from the disastrous
results of a high temperature in a damp climate.
The summer climate of Hongkong, where the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
thermometer rarely rises much above 90°, is on
account of its excessive dampness far more trying
than that of any part of Upper Burma.<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">366</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">BURMESE VILLAGES</div>

<p>I remained at Bhamo from the 15th to the 18th
June, during which time I was treated with the
greatest hospitality by various local residents. On
the morning of the 18th I started for Mandalay on
one of the fine steamers belonging to the Irrawaddy
Flotilla Company, and spent the next two days in
a complete idleness, which, after months of arduous
travelling, I found thoroughly enjoyable. The
scenery of this part of the Irrawaddy is not as a
rule very striking compared with the magnificence
of some of the Chinese rivers, but its placid waters
and the rich vegetation of its banks have a tranquil
beauty of their own which is quite unique. Perhaps
one of the most striking facts about Upper Burma
is that it is one of the few countries where the works
of human hands&mdash;native hands, at least&mdash;have not
spoiled nature's own loveliness. A Chinese village
is seldom a thing of beauty, except as viewed from
a distance:<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">367</a> a Burmese village, on the contrary,
hardly ever mars, and very often accentuates, the
simple beauty of its surroundings. The houses&mdash;built
of wood and bamboo&mdash;look as if they had
grown out, and were still an integral part, of the
virgin forest from which their materials have all
been drawn. Like the statue which, according to
the old Greek fancy, lay hidden in the shapeless
block of marble until the artist's chisel released it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
from its prison, so the Burmese village&mdash;as one
might dream&mdash;was never created by the hand of
man, but only lay buried in the primeval forest
until the hour when the woodman's axe pruned the
luxuriance of the jungle growths. Such, at least,
was the impression that came to me as the
throbbing steam-boat glided rapidly in the silver
morning haze through the noiseless waters of the
great river of Burma. A nearer acquaintance
with the villages&mdash;for we often stopped to embark
cargo or to land passengers&mdash;hardly convinced me
that my dream was an idle one: for the finely-carved
teakwood monasteries and the shining
pagodas with their gilded summits, and, above all,
the graceful figures and merry faces and tasteful
dresses of the people themselves, all tended to
intensify my first impressions. The sites of the
stupas or pagodas are always singularly well chosen.<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">368</a>
It is sad to reflect that some of the beauty of
the Burmese riverside villages is gradually passing
away in obedience to the dismal Western law of
progress. The danger of fire and considerations
of economy, coupled, I fear, with the partial decay
of the exquisite taste which was once the Burman's
birth-right, has brought about the introduction of
new methods of building and foreign architectural
designs. Most incongruous of all are the corrugated-iron
roofs. Can the poor Burman be supplied with
no roofing material less hideous? The Burmese are
wise enough to retain their own national costume,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
a matter for which one should feel grateful; but
the adoption of cheap black European umbrellas
is almost as serious a lapse from good taste as the
use of iron roofing, and is apparently recognised
as such by the authorities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A BURMESE CROWD</div>

<p>When the Prince of
Wales was recently in Mandalay he was entertained
by the Lieutenant-Governor at a water
carnival. It took place on the waters of the moat
close to the walls of Fort Dufferin&mdash;the old royal
city&mdash;and such parts of the grounds as were
open to the public were crowded with Burmese
sightseers, dressed in their finest silks. The show
of colour was unfortunately marred by enormous
numbers of black umbrellas, used as sunshades.
As a Burmese crowd (without umbrellas) is one
of the most charming sights to be seen in Burma
or anywhere else and was therefore well worthy
of a prince's gaze, messengers were hurriedly
despatched to inform the smiling crowd that in
the presence of British royalty umbrellas must
come down. The order was of course obeyed
without a murmur, and the Prince of Wales had
the pleasure of beholding in Mandalay a more
brilliant and picturesque assemblage of his future
subjects than he is ever likely to behold in the
empire's capital.</p>

<p>The most striking scenery on the Irrawaddy
below Bhamo is undoubtedly to be found in what
is known as the Second Defile.<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">369</a> The river at this
point flows through a comparatively narrow channel
in a gorge which is overlooked by a great cliff<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
about 800 feet high. A few years ago I spent
many happy days in a canoe, floating down the
beautiful Nam-U,<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">370</a> from Muang Wa to Luang
Prabang. A short distance above the mouth of
the river, where it joins the Mekong, there is a
stupendous limestone precipice&mdash;how lofty I should
not dare to guess&mdash;which rises sheer out of the
water on the right bank. In situation and appearance
it is similar to the cliff in the Second Defile
of the Irrawaddy, yet, if I can trust my own recollection,
the Nam-U precipice is the loftier and
more magnificent. As, however, the wild beauty
of the Nam-U has never ceased to be a waking
dream ever since I shot its rapids in my little
canoe, and camped on its banks night by night
at the edge of its silent and trackless jungles, it
may be that its most striking features tend in my
own mind to loom larger than the reality. In
any case the Irrawaddy, too, can furnish food for
lifelong dreams of beauty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MANDALAY</div>

<p>Having left Bhamo on 18th June I reached
Mandalay on the morning of the 20th. Here&mdash;for
the purposes of this book at least&mdash;I may
regard my journey as at an end. In travelling
overland from the capital of China to the old
capital of Burma, I had carried out the pleasant
task which I had set myself when I started from
Weihaiwei almost half a year before. It were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
fitting, perhaps, that I should close this imperfect
account of my journey with a description of
the marvels of Mandalay; but I must decline
a task for which no casual visitor can or should
regard himself qualified. A week's residence in
Mandalay is not sufficient to justify any one
except the globe-trotter&mdash;for whom two days
and a night may be sufficient&mdash;in attempting a
description of one of the most curious and
wonderful of the modern cities of Asia. In the
palace grounds I was shown the magnificent
monument which was erected to the memory of
king Mindon,<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">371</a> father of the ex-king Thibaw. I
was told that in a recent book about Burma,
written by one who was too much pressed for
time to sift his facts, there is a fine photograph
of this monument which is described as "the
tomb of king Mindon's favourite Terrier." There
is a moral in this little story which we tourists
would do well to take to heart.</p>

<p>Next to the numerous palace buildings with
their gilded throne-rooms&mdash;no longer, thanks to
Lord Curzon, used as a European club&mdash;the most
interesting sights are outside the walls of the
royal city. No student of Buddhism will omit
to visit that wonderful collection of miniature
temples known as the Kutho-daw, which contains
the whole of the Buddhist Pali canon&mdash;a collection
of sacred writings at least five times as long,
be it remembered, as the whole of the Christian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
Bible&mdash;carved on nearly a thousand slabs of white
marble. Each slab stands upright in a small
pagoda and is fully exposed to view, though
sheltered from the weather. The pagodas are
about seven hundred in number, and are arranged
in symmetrical order side by side, the whole forming
a great square with a temple in the centre.
This wonderful work was carried out by Mindon
Min in 1857, simply as an act of religious devotion.<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">372</a>
The other pagodas of Mandalay and its
neighbourhood are very numerous, and each
possesses interesting features of its own. The
finest is perhaps the Maha Myatmuni, generally
known as the Arakan Pagoda. It contains a
fine brazen colossal image of the Buddha, nearly
twelve feet high, in a sitting posture. Its peculiar
sanctity is derived from the tradition that it was
copied from life and is therefore a true image of
the Buddha as he really was. In mediæval times
wars were waged between several of the kings
of Burma and Indo-China in order to settle the
disputed right of its possession. I was surprised
to find that religious scruples have not prevented
the introduction of electric light into this temple;
but the effect is far from displeasing. The lights
in the recess containing the famous Buddha are so
arranged that, while they strongly illuminate the
image itself, the neighbouring parts of the pagoda,
where I saw many girl-worshippers devoutly
kneeling, are in deep gloom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MANDALAY AS A CENTRE</div>

<p>Starting from Mandalay as a centre I paid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
several visits to other parts of Burma, where I
remained altogether about six weeks. Among
other places I visited Lashio, only a few days'
journey by road from the Salwen at the Kunlon
Ferry, and the furthest point yet attained by
the railway. There I spent a few days as the
guest of the Superintendent of the North Shan
States.<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">373</a> At Maymyo, the charming European
hill-station, I was kindly entertained by Sir
Herbert White, K.C.I.E., Lieutenant-Governor of
Burma, and later on was also his guest at Government
House, Mandalay. Maymyo is only about
four hours distant from Mandalay by train, but
during that short distance the railway climbs a
height of over 3,000 feet. Between Maymyo and
Lashio I broke my journey for a couple of days,
and, under the auspices of Mr D. G. Robertson,
the British Adviser, I had the pleasure of meeting
the reigning chief or sawbwa of the important Shan
State of Hsi-paw. I had hoped to spend some
weeks or months in the trans-Salwen portion of the
province, for the purpose of studying something
of the languages and customs of the numberless
tribes that inhabit that fascinating and little-known
country, and comparing them with what
I knew of the allied tribes in French Laos, and
those through whose territory I had recently passed
in Chinese territory. As travelling in the Shan
States is, however, practically impossible during
the rains, I was obliged indefinitely to postpone
the fulfilment of that part of my programme. As
I hoped to return to the Shan States later on,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
I commenced the study of the language and hired
a Shan servant to accompany me during the
remainder of my stay in Burma.</p>

<p>My next objective was the old capital of
Pagan, on the left bank of the Irrawaddy, below
Mandalay. I spent three days there, exploring
the wonderful ruins of innumerable pagodas and
monasteries which are all that remain of a city
that was once not only the capital of a powerful
kingdom but also one of the leading centres of
learning and religion in south-eastern Asia. The
secular buildings have nearly all disappeared, but
the remaining ruins possess many features of the
greatest interest to archæologists. I could trace
no sign of Chinese influence in the architecture
and decoration of this dead and vanishing city,
though it is alleged&mdash;on doubtful authority&mdash;that
the conquering Chinese arms did once at least
penetrate as far as Pagan. Here, as elsewhere in
Burma, the Chinese invasions do not appear to
have left any lasting results or to have affected
in any way the art of the country.<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">374</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">EUROPEANS IN BURMA</div>

<p>Leaving Pagan I continued my journey down
the Irrawaddy, and reached Rangoon on 15th July.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The conviction that a tour through Burma
must leave in the minds of most Europeans is that
the country is to be congratulated on its people
and that the people are to be equally congratulated
on their country. That Burma itself is one of
the fairest of lands, every traveller can see for
himself; and so far as I could judge from my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
own short experience and from what was told
me by sympathetic British residents, the Burmese
are perhaps the most cheerful, generous and
hospitable, and on the whole the most attractive
people in Asia. But one very commonly hears
them also characterised as frivolous, incorrigibly
lazy, thriftless, superstitious, untruthful, and lacking
in courage and tenacity of purpose. Many
European travellers and others have come to
the conclusion that these sad deficiencies in the
Burman's character are gradually bringing about
the ruin and extinction of his race. They point
to the fact that the population of Rangoon is far
less than half Burman; that Chetty money-lenders,
cooks and labourers from Madras, and Chinese
merchants and shopkeepers, are gradually monopolising
the industry of the country, while the
Burman looks on with apathy at his own displacement
from the fields, kitchens, shops and counting-houses
in which his Indian and Chinese rivals wax
rich and fat. In many European houses&mdash;perhaps
in Lower Burma the great majority&mdash;there is not
a single Burman servant, all the duties of cook,
coolie, table-servant and valet being discharged
by suave, noiseless and obedient natives of India.
The only people who seem to be able to attract
Burmese servants, and keep them for any length
of time, are members of the Civil Service, who, with
their knowledge of the language and familiarity
with the national customs and ideals, are better
able than any other aliens to sympathise with the
Burman in his joys and sorrows, his likes and
dislikes, and to understand something of his point<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
of view. They make good masters, and earn
their reward in retaining the services of loyal and
attached Burmese servants. Of course there are
many non-official Europeans who, with the instincts
of gentlemen, treat their dependents quite as well
and sympathetically as any one; while among the
civil servants there are no doubt many who from
the beginning to the end of their career in Burma
never shake off the feeling of antipathy to the
Oriental&mdash;coupled, probably, with a strong sense of
racial superiority&mdash;which they had when they first
came out to the East. But these exceptional cases
only prove the rule; and it is strong testimony to
the intrinsic worth of the Burman's character that
the more thoroughly he is understood the more
he is liked by those best qualified to judge. The
versatile traveller who "does Burma" in the
course of his round-the-world tour, and fills a
notebook with comments on the character of
the Burmese as a result of what he hears at
the dinner-tables of Rangoon, would do well to
exercise caution before he gives his notebook to
the world. Do not some of us in China well
know how prone the tourist is to echo the too-often
ignorant and one-sided views about the
Chinese that he may have heard expressed in
the clubs and drawing-rooms of Hongkong and
Shanghai? It seems that the situation in Burma
is not dissimilar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BURMESE CHARACTER</div>

<p>I should be courting a well-deserved retort if
I were now to attempt, in a few irresponsible
pages, a complete character-sketch of the Burman
as he appeared to me during my too-brief sojourn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
in his beautiful country. Instead of doing so I
will content myself with recommending the reader
who is interested in Burma but cannot visit it
to read and read again the books that have been
written by such well-informed and sympathetic
writers as Sir George Scott, Mr Fielding Hall and
Mr Scott O'Connor. It is satisfactory to know
from one of these writers that the Burmese are
by no means likely to be crowded out of their
own country by such vigorous workers as the
Madrasis and Chinese. The immigration of these
people enriches the Burman instead of impoverishing
him. It enables him to withdraw from work
which he cordially dislikes, and to devote himself
to the tilling of his rice-fields, and to live the free
life&mdash;and it is by no means an idle one&mdash;that he
best loves. The Burmese are showing no signs
of approaching extinction; on the contrary, they
are multiplying with rapidity.<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">375</a> The Burmese, says
Mr Fielding Hall, are "extremely prosperous now.
There is less poverty, less sickness, less unhappiness
than among any people I have seen East or West.
If there ever was a people about whom pessimism
sounded absurd, it is about the Burmese."<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">376</a> If
there is, however, one characteristic of the Burman
which appears to be beginning to show signs of
decay&mdash;let us hope it is change rather than decay&mdash;it
is his artistic sense. His art, like the art of
India and Ceylon, is, it seems, becoming demoralised.
But that is not due to the example or competition
of any Oriental race; it is a result&mdash;be
it said to our shame&mdash;of the English conquest.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
As regards the common accusation that the
Burman is untruthful, it appears to me that Mr
Fielding Hall has effectually disposed of this in
the book from which I have just quoted. He
points out that because a Burman often lies to
a European&mdash;whom he can hardly help regarding
as an unsympathetic alien&mdash;that does not imply
that he is a liar by nature. "Every man has
many standards. He has one for his family, one
for his friends, one for his own class, one for his
own nation, and a last for all outsiders. No man
considers a foreigner entitled to the same openness
and truth from him as his own people.... The
only way to estimate a people truly is to know
how they treat each other, and how they estimate
each other.... I should say, from what I have
seen, that between Burman and Burman the
standard of honesty and truth is very high. And
between European and Burman it is very much
what the European chooses to make it."<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">377</a> These
remarks, I may add parenthetically, would apply
with equal force to the relations between Europeans
and Chinese.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BURMESE "LAZINESS"</div>

<p>The question of laziness and want of energy
is a very interesting one, and is not so simple as
it appears at first sight. Because the Burman
is glad to leave the rough labour of coolies and
the dreary duties of cooking foreign food and
performing the routine work of house-servant
to the Madrasi, and because he is seen smoking
big cheroots and wearing silk clothes much too
good to work in while his active wife carries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
on the business of the bazaar, the strenuous
Englishman, who knows so well what incessant
hard work has done in building up the greatness
of his own nation, is at first inclined to regard
him with scorn and impatience. Perhaps because
I am conscious of a secret sympathy with a life
of what I may call intelligent indolence, I am not
disposed to execrate the Burman for a fault in
which I am prone to share. But, as a matter of
fact, the Burman is not so idle as he is believed to
be. "Do not suppose," says the eloquent writer
from whom I have quoted, "that the Burmese are
idle. Such a nation of workers was never known.
Every man works, every woman works, every
child works. Life is not an easy thing, but a
hard, and there is a great deal of work to be
done. There is not an idle man or woman in
all Burma."<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">378</a> In the face of a statement so
emphatic as this, how is it that the vice of laziness
is so often attributed to the Burman? The
reason is not far to seek. The Burman lives in
a rich country where the actual necessaries of life
come easily. He may have to work hard at times,
but he does not and need not labour from morning
to night and day after day without intermission.
He is content with little, for he is a frugal eater
and, more often than not, a vegetarian. Money
is of little value to him except to buy some of
the novelties that are poured into Burma from
English factories. No doubt the more he craves
to possess these novelties, the harder he will have
to work to get the money to pay for them: and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
this is a fact that is already having a marked
effect on the national habits. The Burman who
has not become half-occidentalised does not aim
at wealth for its own sake: he does not bow
down and worship people who have money:
Mammon has not yet secured a niche in his
pantheon. He only wants enough to feed his
relations and himself, to bring up his children
in health and strength, and to clothe them with
garments that are not only comfortable to wear
but pleasant to the eye. If his fields produce
more food than he needs, he sells the surplus,
and spends the money in works of charity and
religion and in graceful hospitalities. The consequence
is that at certain seasons of the year&mdash;when
harvests are over, for instance&mdash;he has many
hours of what we might call idleness. He wants
to live, as well as to be a mere machine for the
manufacture of wealth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WESTERN CIVILISATION</div>

<p>The Burmese theory is one which many a
robust and healthy-minded Englishman will absolutely
reject, and perhaps it is as well that the
Englishman should do so. There can be no
progress, he will say, if men are only going to
do sufficient work to bring them their daily food.
To be strenuous and active, to be ready to face
difficulties and strong enough to overcome them&mdash;these
are the only ways to keep ourselves in
the vanguard of progress and civilisation. But,
after all, is there not a good deal to be said for
the Burman's point of view, too? Are we quite
sure that we always know what we mean when we
speak of progress and civilisation? That there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
a terribly sad and ugly side to the development of
civilisation in Western countries&mdash;a sadness and
ugliness chiefly noticeable in the great industrial
centres&mdash;is a dreary fact which no Englishman is
so likely to realise to the full as he who revisits
his native country after a prolonged absence in
the East. Even in the most squalid quarters of
the most densely-populated cities in China I have
never come across anything more painful and
depressing than comes daily within the experience
of those who, like East End missionaries, live in
close proximity to the slums and poorer quarters
of our great English cities. Unfortunately, the
ugliness, if not the squalor, extends itself beyond
the slums, though it assumes different forms among
the middle and upper classes of our people. At
the risk of having one's words stigmatised as cant
and humbug, it is difficult to refrain from giving
utterance to a feeling of wonder that so much of
the energy and activity of the imperial British
race should be devoted to social and political
rivalries and the accumulation of material wealth,
and that modern English life should be so strongly
tainted with the vulgarity and brutality that come
of sordid ideals. Make a Burman a millionaire:
he will build pagodas, he will support monasteries,
he will entertain his friends lavishly, he will exercise
a graceful charity unheard of in the West,&mdash;and
all these things he will go on doing until his
money-bags are so empty that he can carry them
on his back with a light heart. The process will
not be a long one. Transport a hundred Burmans
to work in an English workshop or factory: they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
will probably be all dead or mad in five years; or,
what perhaps is worse, all the joy and buoyancy
will have been crushed out of their souls for ever.
This will not be on account of the hard work&mdash;they
could work harder if necessary&mdash;but because
of the mechanical nature of the labour, the long
hours of sunless confinement, the deadly monotony,
the wearisome routine. Englishmen consider themselves
the apostles of liberty throughout the world.
The Burman, if asked to give his candid opinion
after a year's experience of English life, would
probably say that the position of the vast majority
of Englishmen was not much better than that of
chained slaves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CIVILISATION AND WEALTH</div>

<p>The evils of our civilisation are perhaps less
apparent to him who dwells in its midst than
to him who observes it from afar, yet in England,
too, there have been some sad-voiced prophets.
The warnings of Ruskin, Carlyle and Froude, to
mention few out of the many who have uttered
oracles since the days when Sir Thomas More in
his <cite>Utopia</cite> satirised the love of gold, seem to
have fallen on ears that are deaf to every sound
but the clink of coin upon coin. Even psychologists
and metaphysicians<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">379</a> have condescended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
to come into the arena of practical life to tell us
plain truths about the falseness of our aims and
the barbarities that we have masked with the
forms of civilisation.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The world is too much with us; late and soon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Getting and spending we lay waste our powers."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is not commercialism and industrialism in themselves
that are harmful: it is only too obvious that
our national, or at least our imperial existence is
dependent on our wealth, and that wealth can
come only from flourishing industries and a worldwide
commerce. The harm lies, as Wordsworth
saw, in making wealth our deity instead of our
servant, and "laying waste" the powers and
faculties which are fit for nobler and higher<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
functions by forcing them to act as the apostles
and missionaries of a false god. We are apt to
speak contemptuously of pagan religions. Take
down the most grotesque idol that grins upon
his shelf in India, China or Central Africa, and
put in its place the new god worshipped by
Englishmen and Americans to-day, and who shall
choose between them as fit objects for adoration?</p>

<p>It is frequently taken for granted&mdash;naturally
enough in commercial England&mdash;that the creation
of new wants is one of the finest results of civilisation;
that by artificially creating new desires
among the people of a "backward" race, we not
only enrich ourselves by finding new markets for
our trade, but we elevate and ennoble such a
people by compelling them to lay greater store on
the accumulation of wealth in order that they
may gratify those new desires. That it is unwise
to accept any such theory as axiomatic may be
at least tentatively suggested. "It is popularly
supposed" said Ruskin "that it benefits a nation
to invent a want. Rut the fact is that the true
benefit is in extinguishing a want&mdash;in living with
as few wants as possible."<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">380</a> To see the whole
Burmese nation clad in Lancashire cottons, labouring
with set teeth from morning till night, year
after year, their pagodas deserted and ungilded,
their gleaming blue sky polluted with the smoke
of factory chimneys, their beautiful country turned
into a vast hive of ceaseless and untiring industry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
simply in order that wealth might grow and British
trade prosper, would no doubt be a consummation
most devoutly to be wished by the working classes
of the ruling race, and also by the alien Government
which would congratulate itself on "the
unexampled prosperity of the country and the
gratifying elasticity of the revenue." But, meanwhile,
what of the happiness of the Burmese
people? It is a poor answer to say that if they
do not want European luxuries they are not
compelled to buy them, and that if they despise
money no one is going to force them to accumulate
it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BURMESE IDEALS</div>

<p>If by civilisation we mean an enlightened
progress towards the realisation of the happiness
of mankind&mdash;without necessarily assuming the
truth of the Utilitarian position that human action
ought to be deliberately directed towards the
attainment of the greatest possible sum of pleasures&mdash;there
can be no doubt that the Burmese people
are very high indeed in the scale of civilised races.
Nothing is easier than to criticise such statements.
Some will say that the happiness of a Burman is
a matter of temperament rather than the result of
the conditions of his social environment. The
Christian who holds that his religion is the only
true one, and that all others are false, will condemn
the Burman, because, being a Buddhist and a
nat-worshipper, he is a "heathen." The man of
science will say that in spite of his tolerance and
kind-heartedness and humanity, the Burman
has made no discoveries worth speaking of in
medicine, knows nothing of surgery, and has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
never invented any labour-saving machinery.
In fairness it should be added&mdash;for we are still
discussing civilisation&mdash;that the Burman is not
fond of applying his intellect to the devising of
mechanical contrivances for slaughtering his fellow-men.
Whatever be the shortcomings of his civilisation,
the Burman has made one momentous
discovery, and it is to this point that I have
been trying to lead up: he has discovered how
to make life happy without selfishness, and to
combine an adequate power of hard work with
a corresponding ability to enjoy himself gracefully.
"Put him on the river he loves," says Mr Scott
O'Connor,<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">381</a> "with a swift and angry current
against him, and he is capable of superb effort.
Turn his beautiful craft, enriched with exquisite
carvings, down stream, with wind and tide in his
favour, and he will lie all day in the sun, and
exult in the Nirvana of complete idleness. And
this is not because he is 'a lazy hound,' as I
have heard him called, but because he is a
philosopher and an artist; because there is a
blue sky above him which he can look at, a
river before him rippling with colour and light;
because the earning of pence is a small thing to
him by comparison with the joy of life, and
material things themselves but an illusion of the
temporary flesh."</p>

<div class="sidenote">ORIENTAL CIVILISATION</div>

<p>A few years ago I wandered alone, as I have
said, through the wildest parts of the trans-Mekong
Shan States and Siam. I had no
credentials, no guide, no servants, and had no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
knowledge of the languages spoken around me.
I was received everywhere with the utmost
kindness and the most open-hearted hospitality.
In village after village in the valleys of the
Nam-U and Mekong I found myself an honoured
guest. I could give numberless instances of
the tact and fine feeling constantly displayed by
my hosts in their dealings with the dumb and
unknown foreigner who seemed to have sprung
upon them from nowhere. Money did not come
into the matter at all: it was of no use to
my hosts, for there was hardly any trade, and
all their food and clothes were prepared in their
own villages. During several memorable weeks
I travelled through a fairyland of beauty, sometimes
on foot, sometimes in a canoe or on a
raft. I saw much of the domestic and social
life of the people, and so charming was all I
saw that I fear my pleasure was not untainted
with envy. It seemed to me that not a single
essential of true civilisation was there wanting;
I felt that all my preconceived notions of what
civilisation really meant had been somehow distorted
and must be pulled down and built up
anew. During my few weeks in Burma I did
not travel in the same way, and steamers and
trains gave me little opportunity of seeing Burmese
life from the inside; but from what came under
my own notice, and from what was told me by
others who knew, I have no doubt that where
the Burman has not lost his national graces
through contact with an alien civilisation he is
just as courteous and tolerant and well-mannered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
and "civilised" as those neighbours of his of
whom I have such golden memories.</p>

<p>No doubt one of the greatest achievements
of a civilisation such as that of Laos or Burma
consists in the spirit of peace and restfulness
that it seems to embody. There is, of course, a
fallacy in supposing that a contented feeling of
"having arrived" is to be expected at all in this
human life. Whether we believe in an existence
beyond the grave or not, few of us dare to be
so optimistic as to suppose that perfection in
any form can be realised on earth, although we
instinctively feel that we must not be satisfied
with anything less. Yet when in some parts of
south-eastern Asia we have once breathed that
Nirvana-like spirit of restfulness and peace, may
we not be pardoned if we find there a strange
and magical beauty that all the wisdom of the
West can never yield us? It may be, indeed,
that our complex Western civilisation, in spite of
its materialism and its grossness, contains germs
of a higher perfection than ever Burma or Indo-China
dreamed of. A full realisation of human
capacities, to use the phrase of T. H. Green, can
hardly be expected in a simple form of society
which calls for no great effort and in which there
is no great temptation to deviate from the normal
in either an upward or a downward direction. Our
strenuous Western life, ugly and brutal as much of
it is, and besmirched with the stains of blood and
toil, may yet give birth to ideals nobler than ever
stirred the imagination of southern Asia. The
mountain rent by torrents and chasms, or the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
ocean tearing with white fangs the face of a cliff,
presents to human eyes and minds a spectacle
that contains a deeper and grander meaning than
can ever be conveyed by the fragile beauty of
the royalest of flowers: and the rose, for all its
loveliness, fades and dies. Still, let us not despise
the beauty that is flower-like, even if we meet
it in a land of alien faces: we know that "he is
false to God who flouts the rose."</p>

<div class="sidenote">ORIENTAL CIVILISATION</div>

<p>I have said that the Burman shows himself
able, in play-hours, to enjoy himself gracefully.
In the Burman&mdash;he is not alone among Orientals
in this&mdash;there is no vulgarity. When he and his
friends are having what we might call "a spree,"
he never behaves rudely or uproariously, nor does
he get drunk.<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">382</a> His good taste and self-control
are shown in his demeanour just as they are in
his clothes. He is never a "bounder," either in
manners or appearance. All these remarks apply
with equal force to his women-folk. The Burmese
woman, whatever her class may be and whatever
her occupation, is always a lady. There may
be much merriment, a great deal of noise, a considerable
amount of good-humoured chaff, but
no "mafficking." Can we say quite the same of
"Merrie England"?</p>

<p>It is hardly fair to dwell on the brightest and
most picturesque side of Burmese life&mdash;which
no doubt has its dark side as well&mdash;and compare
it with the gloomier and more horrible features
of the social life of modern England. But what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
I wish to emphasise is the one fact that the
Burmese people of all classes are able to enjoy
themselves&mdash;and do so most heartily&mdash;without
the least admixture of "hooliganism," which a very
large class of our own countrymen and countrywomen
are too obviously unable to do.<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">383</a> If an
intelligent Burman were to visit England and
set himself to discover why it is that among the
poorer classes of our great cities merry-making is
apparently inseparable from hideous and raucous
vulgarity, he would probably ascribe it to the
effect of long hours of degrading and mechanical
labour, the drudgery and incessant routine of daily
life in the sunless workshop and the dismal office&mdash;work
from which the victims, owing to strenuous
competition, derive only the meanest subsistence,
and through which all ideas of gracefulness and
good taste are obliterated, and all sense of beauty
utterly destroyed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BUDDHISM IN BURMA</div>

<p>The most wonderful and beautiful feature
of Burmese life I have barely referred to, and yet
it would deserve a whole volume to itself. The
greatest thing in Burma is the Buddhist religion.
We have been told by several people who ought
to know, that the real religion of Burma is not
Buddhism but Animism;<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">384</a> that Buddhism is merely
an outward label, and that what the Burman really<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
worships is not the law of Buddha, but the nats and
spirits that inhabit the rivers and mountains and
forests. There is, of course, a considerable element
of truth in this criticism, and it applies even more
truly to the Shans than to the Burmese. I have
had evidence of this in the neighbouring countries,
when the Shan boys who guided my canoe down
the rivers of Laos used to stop to offer up prayers
to the river-nats whenever we came to a dangerous
rapid. But to describe Buddhism in Burma as a
mere label seems&mdash;though I say it with all deference
to those who know better&mdash;to be an exaggeration.
The Burmans not only "profess and call themselves"
Buddhists, but they are brought up in
the tenets of that religion from their earliest
childhood, and before the British Government
established secular schools they received all their
education from Buddhist monks within the walls
of Buddhist monasteries. The great majority do
so still, though some are sent to the secular
schools as well. Like the Siamese, all Burmese
boys at some time or other wear the yellow
robe and take the monastic vows. Most of them
return as a matter of course to the secular life,
but it would be contrary to all human experience
to expect them to forget the religion they
have been taught both at home and at school
during their most impressionable years; and, as a
matter of fact, throughout their lives they continue
to have the greatest reverence for the
yellow robe&mdash;the symbol, in their eyes, of all
that is holy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BUDDHISM AND ANIMISM</div>

<p>I would go so far as to say that the average<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
Burman of the present day is at least as much
entitled to the name of Buddhist as the average
Englishman or German is to the name of
Christian.<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">385</a> The law of Buddha is certainly not
broken by Burmans in the same lighthearted
manner that European Governments and individuals
consistently break the commands contained
in the Sermon on the Mount: it is not
contemptuously thrust aside as "an excellent ideal,
but quite unworkable in practice." Buddhism, as
it is taught and practised in Burma, is a beautiful
religion. I never met a single European in Burma&mdash;I
must admit that I did not come in contact
with the Christian missionaries there&mdash;who had a
single harsh word to say about the wearers of the
yellow robe,<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">386</a> or the general effect of their teachings.
Whatever their own religious views may
be, all Europeans seem ready to acknowledge that
Buddhism was and still is a great power for good,
and that it will be a dismal day for the Burmese
people when their religion decays or relaxes its
hold upon them. Fortunately, there seems to be
every reason to believe that it will not do so, that
Buddhism is for the Burman, if for no other, a
κτῆμα ἐς ἀεί. It seems strange to be told by one
of the foremost living exponents of Burmese life
and character that the professed religion of Burma
is only "an electro-plating, a bloom, a varnish,
enamel, lacquer, a veneer."<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">387</a> Surely this must not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
be taken quite seriously. A "bloom," a "varnish,"
a "veneer" suggests something that may be more
or less easily rubbed off, without materially affecting
the substance on which it has been laid. Can
it be held in good faith that Buddhism could be
rubbed away like the bloom from a grape and
leave the Burmese people substantially unaffected?
Do the gentleness, the patience, the humanity,
the kindness to animals, the winning manners and
the limitless charity and generosity of the Burmese
owe nothing to Buddhism? If Buddhism
has had even a minor share in the shaping of the
character of the modern Burman we dare not
call it a mere bloom or varnish. That there is,
however, a very broad stratum of animism in the
various deposits that have helped through the
shadowy centuries of an unrecorded past to build
up the religious mind of Burma may be granted
without dispute. Animism, as we know, is to be
traced in the popular versions of all or nearly all
the religious systems of the world. The eleventh
book of the <cite>Odyssey</cite> is&mdash;as F. W. H. Myers
has remarked&mdash;"steeped in animism,"<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">388</a> and we
have only to turn to the eighth book of the
<cite>Æneid</cite><a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">389</a> to find that even in the polished age of
Augustus animistic ideas were far from dead.
Brahmanism, Buddhism, Islam, the Greek and
Roman mythologies, the popular semi-religious
superstitions of China and Japan, and Christianity<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">390</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
are all to some extent interpenetrated with animism,
and it is only natural that in the case of Buddhism
the animistic influences should be specially strong:
for that faith enshrines, among the noble and
simple moral teachings that all can understand,
a profound philosophical system far beyond the
comprehension of the average half-educated
peasant; and it has always shown, perhaps, even
too generous a tolerance of the alien opinions and
practices with which it has come in contact.</p>

<p>We are told by the well-known writer on
Burma from whom I have just quoted, that when
in 1888 the <i lang="my">hti</i> (pinnacle) of the Shwe Dagon
Pagoda at Rangoon was thrown down by an
earthquake, a magnificent new one, costing 600,000
rupees, all collected by public subscription, was
put up by gratuitous labour.<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">391</a> I am far from
wishing to lay any emphasis on the significance
of the mere voluntary expenditure of so large a
sum of money, for we know that in Burma all
wealth is dross, and that as judged by Burmese
ideas few of the rich philanthropists of Europe
would rank as other than mere misers; but the
fact of the gift of <i>gratuitous labour</i> by a people
who are constantly stigmatised as "lazy dogs"
and haters of all kinds of hard work, is surely
worthy of a moment's consideration. The average
Briton is credited with being anything but lazy,
yet what would Christian England say if the
Primate were to call upon the British workman
to give the work of his hands for nothing in the
restoration of St Paul's Cathedral? The result<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
of his appeal might possibly suggest in some minds
the disquieting reflection that the Burmese were
not the only people whose professed religion was
a mere "varnish."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SHWE DAGON</div>

<p>Any one who visits the pagodas and watches
the people at their devotions&mdash;they make a far
more beautiful picture, by the way, than the congregation
of any European church, though that
is not to the point&mdash;is not likely to see anything
suggestive of the decay of Buddhism. There
are, on the contrary, healthy signs of a renewed
religious activity which, if guided aright, should
lead to splendid results and silence all forebodings.
Meanwhile, the jewelled pinnacle of
"the greatest cathedral of the Buddhist faith"<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">392</a>&mdash;the
Shwe Dagon Pagoda&mdash;still bears silent
witness to the vitality and beauty of the religion
which called it into being. So long as the
Buddhist faith is a living force in Burma, there
will never be wanting eager hands to dress the
altars and lay gold-leaf on the dome of that
splendid fane, and never will the grand and
passionless face of the Lord Buddha be averted
from the little Burmese children who with their
fathers and mothers come to lay their gifts of
flowers at the Master's feet. If Buddhism dies
out of Burma the country will lose the most
precious of all its possessions; and when the Shwe
Dagon, deserted by its last pilgrim, crumbles away
into a shapeless heap of bricks, the world's diadem
will lose one of its most lustrous gems.</p>

<p class="center">CONCLUSION</p>


<p>From Burma I returned to north China by slow
and easy stages, covering a period of two and a
half months. As, however, I visited no part
of the Far East which is not thoroughly well
known to the ordinary tourist, I will spare my
readers an account of peoples and localities which
have been often and well described by others.
Leaving Rangoon by steamer on 19th July, I
reached Colombo on the 24th, and as the guest
of Sir Henry Blake, G.C.M.G., then Governor of
Ceylon, I spent six delightful weeks in touring
through the island by train and motor-car. At
Anuradhapura I obtained a seedling from the
famous Bo-tree<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">393</a>&mdash;probably the oldest surviving
historical tree in the world&mdash;and took it away to
plant in the Public Gardens of Hongkong. I
trust it is still there, and that it will do credit
to its illustrious origin. From Ceylon I passed
through Singapore, Hongkong and Shanghai, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
crossed thence to Japan. After nearly a fortnight
in the island of Kyūshū I paid a short
visit to Korea, and finally returned to Weihaiwei
on 5th October, after an absence of exactly nine
months. My faithful dog, which had accompanied
me through all the vicissitudes of my
journey and had never had a day's illness, died
suddenly, shortly after my return to China.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RETURN TO CHINA</div>

<p>After the various journeys that I have made
in different parts of China, I am often asked how
I have been treated by the Chinese people, and
to what extent I have suffered inconvenience from
their notorious hatred for foreigners. The reader
who has been so indulgent as to follow me carefully
through the preceding pages has probably
a good idea of what my answer to such questions
is likely to be. In the course of more than nine
years' residence in China I have travelled in ten
provinces, and have never had cause for a single
serious complaint against any class or any individual.
By the official classes I have almost invariably
been treated with scrupulous courtesy, and
at the hands of the people I have experienced only
kindness and hospitality. It is hardly possible for
me to cite a single exception to this rule; and if
it were not for the fact that other Europeans&mdash;missionaries
and travellers&mdash;have sometimes had
a different tale to tell, I should have no hesitation
in saying that no more kindly or hospitable people
exist than the people of China. They have certainly
not the charm and grace of manner that
are so characteristic of some of the Shan tribes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
or the people of Burma, Siam and Japan, and
it is sometimes a little disconcerting to see them
hurrying their children out of sight in case the
Western ogre should want to cut out their eyes
to make into foreign medicine. There are Chinese
and Chinese, and good manners are less characteristic
of one locality than of another. My own
experience of the peasantry of eastern Shantung,
with whom I am best acquainted, goes to show
that they are good-tempered, reasonable, orderly
and law-abiding, inveterate gamblers, quick to
appreciate a kindness, good husbands and devoted
fathers, neither more nor less intelligent than
others of their class elsewhere, rather too fond
of flattering the foreign official because they think
he is fool enough to like it, singularly lacking in
the proverbial conceit of his race, full of humour,
a liar in the law-courts but truthful and honest outside
them, and courageous in facing hardship and
disappointment. My slighter acquaintance with the
agricultural classes of other provinces forbids me
to attempt any general characterisation, and even
in our little territory of Weihaiwei&mdash;about 300
square miles in extent, with 160,000 people&mdash;there
are differences and exceptions which must modify
any general statement. The people of Kuangtung&mdash;the
province from which issue the majority of
Chinese emigrants&mdash;are in my opinion less attractive
than those of many other provinces. They
have sturdy qualities, are sober and industrious,
enterprising and independent, but are rather too
truculent and too much given to brawling. But
this applies only to the lower classes, and especially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
to the "rolling-stones" that find their way to the
coast-ports, for the typical Cantonese gentleman
would be an ornament to any society in the world.</p>

<div class="caption">A VILLAGE FAIR IN CHINA, WITH OPEN-AIR THEATRE.</div>
</div>


<div class="sidenote">CHINESE OF THE COAST-PORTS</div>

<p>That the Chinese people have in the past been
misunderstood is due to a variety of quite unavoidable
circumstances for which no one can be said
to be responsible. The intolerable arrogance of
the Chinese Court, up to very recent days, in all
its dealings with other Powers, tended to spread
the belief that this attitude was characteristic
of the whole Chinese people. The admission of
foreign merchants to certain "treaty ports" did
not tend to bring about much change of feeling,
for though the Chinese mercantile classes soon
won, through their honesty and fair dealing, a
liking or respect which they have never ceased to
deserve, the European settlements early became the
resort of the worst type of Chinese ruffian. The
emigrants from Kuangtung and other provinces
of south-eastern China have in the Straits Settlements,
California and Australia proved themselves
well-behaved and law-abiding members of society;
but among them, too, there were many who left
their country "for their country's good," and
who, had they not prudently sought refuge
on foreign shores, would have suffered a worse
fate than mere exile. Great numbers of the
coolies who were sent to work in the South
African mines, and whose various malpractices
there have raised so natural an outburst of disgust
and indignation, belonged to the vicious and
criminal classes of north China, and even the best
of them were recruited from the lowest ranks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
of society. Chinese officialdom, needless to say,
was only too delighted to see the last of them.
Unfortunately, even a visit to Shanghai or Hongkong
does not tend to modify very appreciably
the unfavourable opinion of the Chinese which
the average Englishman may have formed from
his previous knowledge of that race. Whatever
may be the cause&mdash;and several causes might be
assigned&mdash;the lower-class Chinese of Hongkong
probably have worse manners than any other
inhabitants of the Chinese empire. The coolies
who wilfully jostle Europeans in Queen's and
Des Vœux Roads, and snatch watches and purses
from ladies and children, the house-servants who
are impertinent to their European mistresses in
their masters' absence, and the shopkeepers who
blink rudely at their foreign customers and remain
seated, sleepily fanning their paunches, when
according to their own canons of good manners
they should be on their feet murmuring polite
salutations&mdash;all these are persons to whom a
glimpse of Western civilisation seems to have
done nothing but harm. They have lost their
own manners, and have altogether failed to acquire
those of the Occident. For my own part, I may
say that though I have travelled through a great
part of China and visited many of her large cities,
I have found nowhere such lack of manners as
unfortunately characterises a large proportion of
our fellow-subjects in Hongkong.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RACIAL ANTIPATHIES</div>

<p>It must be admitted that the Chinese do not
like foreigners. It is all the more creditable to
them that their native courtesy&mdash;outside the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
European settlements&mdash;so often prevents them
from showing their dislike. Here and there, no
doubt, a real friendship springs up between a
foreigner and a Chinese, owing to qualities which
each finds and appreciates in the other, but as a
rule the feeling hardly goes beyond one of respect.
Though many Chinese gentlemen in Hongkong
are naturalised British subjects and are men of
education and culture, they are practically excluded
from the charmed circle of Hongkong
"Society." It must be granted, of course, that a
difficulty is introduced into the situation through
the incompatible social customs of the two races,
especially with regard to the position of women.
But the difficulty is not, as it may be in the case
of English and Hindus, an insuperable one. The
total absence of caste-rules and the willingness
of intelligent Chinese to relax the rigidity of their
own social laws deprive Europeans of the excuse
that friendly intercourse with the Chinese is from
the nature of things an impossibility.</p>

<p>Dr Martineau tells us that the man who goes
abroad and comes in contact with alien civilisations
is at first chafed by every sound and sight
of foreign things, and thinks he has left everything
good behind him at home; but that as he
grows accustomed to his surroundings he is "hit
by many a happy phrase and won by many
a graceful usage, and fairly conquered at last
by a literature and art and national life which
reveal to him an unimagined type of human culture."<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">394</a>
Unfortunately all travellers and residents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
in foreign lands are not so easily dragged out
of their prejudices as this passage would seem
to imply. Indeed, it is hardly an exaggeration
to say that the stay-at-home Englishman is
often more apparently sympathetic towards alien
races than those who come in daily contact with
them. This, however, is too frequently due to
a most dangerous form of ignorance,<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">395</a> that has
already&mdash;within the British Empire&mdash;caused a
good deal of possibly irreparable mischief. In
spite of warning after warning, many an Englishman
is still apt to think that Orientals under
British rule should be put in possession of all the
political "rights" of the Briton at home, and is
constitutionally unable to see that a political and
social system which has been slowly created during
centuries of national growth by and for men of
his own race may prove not only detrimental but
even ruinous to the true interests&mdash;political, social
and moral&mdash;of his Oriental fellow-subjects. It is
quite possible&mdash;I desire to lay special stress on
this point&mdash;that a sympathetic and broad-minded
Englishman may have the highest regard for the
individuals of an Oriental race, the deepest admiration
for many aspects of Oriental life and character,
and the keenest appreciation of the many splendid
achievements of the East in art, philosophy and
religion, and that he may nevertheless consistently
repudiate any concurrence with the illogical
doctrine that what is good for one is good for all,
and that the aspirations of the Englishman must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
necessarily coincide with the aspirations of the
Hindu or the Chinese. I would even go further,
and say that the man who wishes to fit out the
Oriental with a complete equipment of Western
ideals proves thereby that he has either no understanding
of or no true sympathy with Eastern
peoples and Eastern modes of thought: and that
if he tries to give practical effect to his theories
he will prove himself that most dangerous of foes&mdash;the
mischief-maker who comes in the guise of
a smiling friend.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DIFFERENT APTITUDES</div>

<p>Every exiled Englishman who as a Government
official is brought into direct contact with
a large population of Asiatics is well aware that
if his object is to win a certain kind of precarious
popularity among those whom he assists in ruling,
there is ready to his hand a cheap and nasty way
of attaining his ambition. Fortunately for the
honour of England and the stability of the Empire,
he is generally content with the less dazzling
rewards that come from the honest performance
of duty. It has recently been reported by the
newspapers that an English politician, a few hours
after he had set foot on Indian soil for the first
time, informed crowded Hindu audiences that he
proposed to assist them in securing a constitution
similar to that possessed by Canada, on the
ground that "what was good for the Canadians
must be good for the Indians"; in consequence
of which it was arranged by half-educated Hindu
demagogues that he should be greeted with the
plaudits of million-throated Bengal, garlanded with
flowers and hailed as "an angel and not a man."<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
Meanwhile, scattered throughout India are
hundreds of able and experienced Englishmen&mdash;members
of the Civil Service&mdash;who are giving
the best years of their lives to India and her
people, who can speak the Indian vernaculars
and know the Indian mind and character as well
as they can be known by any foreigner, and
who are carrying on day by day the great
administrative work that saves India from chaos.
Few of their names are known to the British
public, and not one of them&mdash;so far as I am
aware&mdash;has ever been hailed by a Hindu mob as
"an angel." How is it that a roving politician
has managed so quickly to out-run them all in the
race for popularity? Perhaps, if the truth were
known, most of them could, if they so desired,
attain the dizzy elevation of this kind of angelhood
without much difficulty; but the pity of it is
that as time went on they would find the conditions
of continued success growing ever more
and more stringent, till at last they would have
to be something greater even than angels to satisfy
the expectations of their admirers. The young
Englishmen of half a century hence might have
cause to lament that their fathers had not limited
their ambitions in this life to terrestrial instead of
extending them to celestial promotion, and the
young Hindus, as they sat amid the ruins of their
violated temples or crouched under the lash of the
Mohammedan, would perhaps bitterly wish that
their sires had known how to give honour where
honour was due, and had turned a deaf ear to the
ignorant rhetoric of native and foreign demagogues.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">PREJUDICES</div>

<p>But the Englishman at home, who in a spirit
of misdirected generosity aims at conferring on
the Asiatic all the political and other "blessings"
(if indeed they are such, even in England) that
he himself enjoys, oblivious of the fact that under
Asiatic conditions the blessings may turn into
curses, is guilty of a blunder no graver nor more
dangerous than that committed by the Englishman
abroad who acts on the other assumption that
the Oriental was created to be the white man's
slave. This attitude is unfortunately traceable
among a certain class of Europeans in both India
and China;<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">396</a> and in China it has certainly tended
to widen the natural gulf that Nature has fixed
between the hearts and intellects of East and
West.</p>

<p>That the Chinese in general have no liking
for the foreigner seems to me a matter for no
surprise whatever. I think I am not far wrong
when I say that the average young European
comes to the East with a prejudice against the
Chinese, and a distinct idea that they are his
inferiors. Of course in a sense this form of
national prejudice exists all the world over. The
English schoolboy used to believe that every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
Englishman was as good as three Frenchmen.<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">397</a>
The French of the Middle Ages used to retort
that Englishmen had tails, which is just what many
educated Chinese of the present day believe of
the Miao-tzŭ tribes. The ancient Greeks called
every one else "barbarian." In our own day we
have it on the word of an emperor that the real
"salt of the earth" are the people of Germany:
more recently, indeed, the salt has been metamorphosed
"into the block of granite upon which
the Lord God can complete His work of civilising
the world."<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">398</a> Yet was it not only a few years ago
that a statesman assured us that the torch of
civilisation had now definitely passed to Russia?
It was a Russian statesman, of course, who said
so: and the Englishman or the American may
smile at the self-assurance of this or any other
nation that arrogates to itself the rôle which, as
he has always been convinced, exclusively belongs
to the Anglo-Saxon. Yet this kind of national
partiality&mdash;provided it is accompanied by a belief
in the principle of <i lang="fr">noblesse oblige</i>&mdash;is by no means
to be sneered at or despised. "The sense of greatness
keeps a nation great," and an honest belief
in our own lofty destiny will stand us in good
stead in the day of trial. If two nations of equal
powers and resources come to blows, and one of
them happens to be actuated by a belief, lacking
to the other, in its "divine mission," we need be
in no doubt as to the side on which victory
will declare itself. But the feelings with which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
Europeans and Chinese too often regard each other
are different in kind from the national prejudices
that we know so well and make allowances for
in the West.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OFFICIAL BEARING</div>

<p>In our relations with China we have been
constantly offended by the air of superiority that
is assumed towards us by the Chinese Government
and by Chinese officials. They used to call us
"barbarians" even in official documents, just as the
street urchins of Canton still hail us as "foreign
devils"; and we can never forget that Chinese
officialdom used to do its best to humiliate us in
our relations with the Court at Peking in a manner
which was altogether intolerable. Of course, the
Chinese were wrong in assuming a non-existing
superiority, and they have had to pay bitterly for
their arrogance. But is it not the case that we,
as individuals and as Governments, have shown
in different but not less provocative ways just
as much unreasonable arrogance in our treatment
of the Chinese? "The Chinese complain," writes
a fair-minded American diplomatist,<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">399</a> "that an
air of proprietorship is constantly manifested in unreasonable
demands and impertinent criticisms, in
denunciation of any of their officials who manifest
a disposition to protect native interests, and that
it practically amounts to a refusal to recognise
China as the property of the Chinese. They
object, perhaps unreasonably, against the application
to their empire of those two well-known
declarations, said to have been made by the
unanimous voice of a religious body: 'Resolved,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
that the righteous shall inherit the earth. Resolved,
that we are the righteous.'"</p>

<p>Many Europeans not only hold the view that
Chinese civilisation is inferior to that of Europe&mdash;which
is doubtless to a great extent true, though
there is another aspect of that question&mdash;but they
are strongly convinced that the Chinese represent
a lower type of humanity&mdash;that they are, in
fact, less far advanced in the scale of evolution
than Europeans. An educated Englishman once
told me that the Chinese were evidently a mean
and inferior people, because when you whacked a
Chinese coolie in the streets of Canton<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">400</a> he did
not hit you back. This argument is curiously
typical of the aggressive attitude which is so
often assumed by Europeans not only in their
dealings with Chinese, but also in their relations
with all other Oriental races, whose lack of "grit"
is supposed to be proved by the fact that they are
not so ready with their fists as we are. One of
the most enlightened Hindus of our own day&mdash;the
late Swami Vivekananda&mdash;quotes as a curious
instance of this attitude a remark that was made
to him in London. "What have you Hindus
done?" said an English girl, full of the pride of
race. "You have never even conquered a single
nation."</p>

<div class="sidenote">"INFERIORITY"</div>

<p>Now, setting aside all considerations of national
prejudice and patriotism, is it a fact that the
Chinese are as a race inferior to the peoples of
the West? The question, when we examine it
closely, has really very little to do with political<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
strength or military efficiency, or (<i lang="la">pace</i> Mr
Benjamin Kidd) relative standards of living, or
even the usual material accompaniments of what
we call an advanced civilisation; it is a question
for the trained anthropologist and the craniologist
rather than for the casual observer of men and
manners. The Japanese people are now much
more highly civilised, according to Western
notions, than they were half a century ago, but
it would be ludicrously erroneous to say that
they are now a higher race, from the evolutionary
point of view, than they were then.
Evolution does not work quite so rapidly as that
even in these days of "hustle." The Japanese
have advanced, not because their brains have
suddenly become larger, or their moral and
intellectual capabilities have all at once made a
leap forward, but because their intercourse with
Western nations, after centuries of isolated
seclusion, showed them that certain characteristic
features of European civilisation would be of
great use in strengthening and enriching their
own country, developing its resources, and giving
it the power to resist aggression. If the Japanese
were as members of the genus <i lang="la">homo sapiens</i> inferior
to us fifty years ago, they are inferior to us now.
If they are our equals to-day&mdash;and the burden
of proof certainly now rests on him who wishes
to show that they are not&mdash;our knowledge of
the origin and history of Eastern peoples, scanty
though it is, should certainly tend to assure us
that the Chinese are our equals too. There is no
valid reason for supposing that the Chinese people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
are ethnically inferior to the Japanese. They
have preserved their isolated seclusion longer
than the Japanese, because until very recently it
was less urgently necessary for them to come
out of it. They have taken a longer time
to appreciate the value of Western science and
certain features of Western civilisation, because
new ideas take longer to permeate a very large
country than a small one, and because China was
rich in the possession within her own borders of
all the necessaries of life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">STAGES IN CIVILISATION</div>

<p>Many Europeans, dazzled and blinded by the
marvellous inventions and discoveries of modern
times, and the huge strides made by physical
science, are apt to conclude too hastily that our
ethnical superiority is sufficiently proved by the
fact that all or nearly all such achievements are
due to the white races only.<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">401</a> Even the Japanese,
we are often reminded, are after all only our
imitators, and being so must necessarily be our
inferiors. If an artist were to make so excellent
a copy of the Madonna di San Sisto as to deceive
connoisseurs into the belief that it was the original,
he would not thereby elevate himself to an equality
with Raphael. But surely it is much too soon to
make generalisations about the relative development
of Eastern and Western nations from the few
facts at our command. It is only during the last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
one or two hundred years that science has achieved
her greatest triumphs in Europe, and it is with
the aid of those triumphs of science and partly as
a direct result of them that European civilisation
has progressed during that time. Yet even with
us popular opinion has not always been on the side
of advancing science. I once heard a charming
old lady declare that balloons or air-machines of
any kind would never be successful, because the
Almighty in His wisdom had decreed that mankind
was to restrict its movements to the solid earth,
and that even the attempt to make such machines
was&mdash;like the building of a certain mythical tower
that we have all heard of&mdash;an act of impiety which
would certainly bring down divine vengeance. Yet
the man who now denies that we are within
measurable distance of the conquest of the air&mdash;especially
if he denies it on religious grounds&mdash;is
not likely to be listened to with much respect at
the present day. Many persons&mdash;pious and other&mdash;were
strongly opposed to the construction of
railways in England in the early part of the nineteenth
century. We grew impatient with the
Chinese, because, until very recently, they showed
similar reluctance to the introduction of railways
and machinery into their own country, thus proving
that they were oblivious of the enormous economic
benefits that such innovations had conferred upon
every country that had adopted them; yet we do
not regard the University of Oxford as having
been the last stronghold of barbarism in England,
because that venerable corporation for a long time
opposed the approach of a railway to its classic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
halls, nor do we consider that Lancashire was
less civilised than the rest of England in the
eighteenth century, because its cotton-spinners
rose in their thousands to resist by force the
introduction of Sir Richard Arkwright's spinning-frame.
If we are willing to admit that Oxford and
Lancashire did not act from a mere blind hostility
to modern inventions as such, we should at
least be willing to enquire whether the opposition
of the Chinese has not also been due to
other causes than mere barbarism or lack of
intelligence.</p>

<p>I do not think it can be seriously contended
that the civilisation of China to-day is on the
whole lower than that of Europe in the comparatively
recent days of the thumb-screw and
the Holy Office, and it is possible that in the
K'ang Hsi period (1662-1722) China was as
civilised as most of the countries of Europe were
at the same period. In that case it is not much
more than two hundred years since European
civilisation began to move ahead of that of China&mdash;a
very short period in a nation's history, and
almost infinitesimal from the point of view of the
evolution of mankind.<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">402</a> Our racial superiority to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
the Chinese may be an anthropological truth, but
it cannot be deduced merely from the fact that
during the most recent portion of our national
existence we have invented steam engines or wireless
telegraphy or quick-firing guns or turbine
battleships or even party government.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHINESE CIVILISATION</div>

<p>That Chinese civilisation has for many years
been allowed to get into a very bad state of
repair is, of course, an undoubted fact. Not to
mention the various terrible outbursts of hatred
against foreigners, for which the aggression of
foreign Governments has generally been to a great
extent responsible, no excuse can be found for
the atrocities committed in the Chinese criminal
law-courts, or the unsatisfactory position of
women, or the binding of girls' feet, or the
defective educational system, or the low state
of the arts of medicine and surgery, or the corruption
of the official classes and the numberless
administrative abuses. All these and many other
evils must be rectified before China can expect
to take her proper place in the front rank of the
nations of the world. That she is now making
an honest endeavour to rectify them in the face
of immense difficulties must, I think, be apparent
to all observers, but we cannot expect that great
social and political changes can be introduced into
so enormous a country as China merely by the
issue of a series of imperial decrees, and it is but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
too probable that before she can enter upon the
heritage that is rightly hers, China has yet to
pass through a terrible ordeal of fire. It is also
far from unlikely that in the early stages of her
new career she will be forced by circumstances
into various reactionary phases which may give
foreigners the mistaken impression that she is
about to fall back again into her old lethargy
and somnolence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT</div>

<p>Some of the existing features of Chinese civilisation
are so admirably suited to the genius of the
people that they might with great advantage be
allowed to remain almost unchanged. If everything
goes into the melting pot, China will lose
almost as much as she can ever hope to gain. It
is a great mistake, for example, to suppose that
the Chinese system of government is thoroughly
bad. The Government has failed so often and so
signally to uphold the dignity of China in her
quarrels with other Powers that we are apt to
regard the whole system as rotten, inside and
out. We are told so much about official corruption
and the inhumanities of Chinese gaols and
the cruel acts of oppression practised by the
ruling classes and their underlings, that some
may be surprised to learn not only that there
are hundreds of admirable officials, zealous and
single-minded in the discharge of their duties,
but that the majority of the people of China
are quite unconscious of being oppressed, and
would be bewildered if one were to suggest that
such was the case. The "squeezes" of the
officials and their subordinates are thoroughly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
well recognised by every one concerned, and acts
of real extortion are by no means so common as
Europeans believe, though there have no doubt
been several serious cases of malversation of
funds subscribed by Chinese and foreigners for
such laudable objects as famine relief. It is true,
moreover, that the official classes have often shown
a cynical disregard for the sanctity of private
property, and this has compelled many rich Chinese
to invest their money in Shanghai and Hongkong.
As regards the ordinary "squeezes," the imperial
Government knows quite well that the salaries
paid to the officials do not amount to a living
wage, and that to eke out their slender incomes
they must pocket fees and percentages which have
no legal sanction.</p>

<p>The criminal convicted in a Chinese court is
well aware that he must fee his gaolers&mdash;that
is practically part of his punishment for being
a criminal. The party to a civil lawsuit knows
equally well that he cannot hope to get a hearing
till he has paid something to every one
connected with the court, from door-keeper to
magistrate's secretaries, and that if he wins his
case he will have to pay more: but he, too, knew
all this before he decided to go to law, and he
regards all these payments much as we should
regard a solicitor's bill of costs. Real acts of
extortion and oppression are often practised in
individual cases, but it is a strong light that beats
upon the judgment seat of a Chinese official, and
if he becomes notorious for such acts he must
have exceedingly influential support if he expects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
to escape denunciation and disgrace. It is the
sale of offices, the selfishness of the highest ruling
classes, the ignorance and prejudices of the court,
the malversation of funds that ought to be devoted
to paying for fleets and armies and public works,
that China suffers from so bitterly to-day, not the
comparatively small extortions practised by local
officials.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE</div>

<p>Even taking extortion and "squeezes" into
consideration, China is a lightly-taxed country;
and we should remember that in times of famine
or other distress it is quite common for the
Government to remit all direct taxes throughout
the whole area affected. A Chinese magistrate is
held responsible for the peace and well-being of
his district just as a father is held responsible for
the conduct of his son. The people whom he
rules know this very well, and are fully conscious
of their own power to ruin his official career if
he consistently tries to extort more than the
recognised "squeezes," or is guilty of any gross
acts of maladministration.<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">403</a> In connection with
civil lawsuits, intentional miscarriages of justice
are far less frequent than is usually supposed.
The parties may be required to pay what we
should call bribes, and sometimes the hearing of
a case is intentionally postponed from day to day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
until the bribes offered are sufficiently large; but
the important point to notice is, that all this
bribery does not necessarily imply a miscarriage
of justice. Considering the wide areas over which
Chinese district magistrates preside, and the slight
amount of supervision exercised over their proceedings,
it is not an exaggeration to say that
great numbers of them are able and well-meaning
officials who have an honest desire to benefit the
people committed to their charge and to serve
their country loyally. We find, too, that the
men who show such qualifications in a conspicuous
degree are almost sure of rapid advancement; nor
do they fail to earn the respect and affection of
the people whom they rule, for there is no one
quicker than a Chinese to realise when he is well
governed, and perhaps no one more appreciative.</p>

<p>The social organisation of China, especially
for an agricultural people, is in many respects
thoroughly sound. In ordinary times&mdash;that is,
when no extraordinary events such as famines or
political troubles occur to complicate matters&mdash;China
is one of the most profoundly peaceful
countries in the world. The fact that hated
foreigners can safely go through the country from
end to end without any means of self-protection
is in itself a striking proof of this. The people
are singularly law-abiding. There are no policemen
in the European sense except in a few large
cities like Peking, Ch'êng-tu and K'ai-fêng-fu,
where Western institutions are beginning to be
copied, and yet there is probably a smaller percentage
of crime in China than in any country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
in Europe. This is partly due, no doubt, to the
naturally peaceful and industrious character of
the people, but it is an almost necessary corollary
of their semi-patriarchal village system and the
responsibility of each family for the good behaviour
of all its members. In the three hundred and ten
villages of the leased territory of Weihaiwei the
policy of the British Government has been to rule
the people as far as possible in the way to which
from time immemorial they have been accustomed.
The village organisation is maintained, and in the
courts of the two British magistrates the law that
is administered is the law of China (tempered by
local custom), so far as such law and custom are
not repugnant to British conceptions of justice and
morality. In my own district, which is nearly 200
square miles in extent, and contains about two
hundred villages with nearly a hundred thousand
inhabitants, there are eight police constables permanently
stationed at headquarters, ready to be
sent out to discharge any duties that may be
necessary, but apart from them there is not a
policeman in the district. During a recent period
of six months&mdash;including the winter months, which
are always the season for serious crime in north
China&mdash;the cases of robbery reported to the police
were three in number. Out of about eighty cases
in which during the same period imprisonment
or fines were imposed, nearly half were gambling
cases and the rest of a more or less trifling nature.
When riding through the villages of the territory
I do not remember to have seen more than one
intoxicated man, and he had been to market and sold all his pigs.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">WEIHAIWEI</div>

<p>During more than two years in
Weihaiwei I have tried Englishmen and Japanese
for being "drunk and disorderly," but never a
single Chinese. I must hasten to explain that
the absence of crime and disorder in Weihaiwei
is not in the least degree due to any reforms introduced
by the British Government: the neighbouring
districts under Chinese rule are just as well
behaved, if not, indeed, rather more so. Perhaps
I should add that civil lawsuits in Weihaiwei are
exceptionally numerous. Such cases are decided
by the two British magistrates in accordance with
Chinese law and are conducted in the Chinese
language. The only expense which a litigant
incurs is a shilling or two for hiring a petition-writer
to state his case, and even this outlay he
can avoid if he happens to be an educated man
and can write out an intelligible statement for
himself, or get a friend to do it for him. There
are no court fees, no "squeezes," and solicitors
and barristers are unknown. I am not quite
satisfied that the facilities offered to litigants in
our courts in Weihaiwei are altogether beneficial
in their results. Litigation has become so cheap
and easy that it is often resorted to before the
least serious attempt has been made by the parties
to come to an amicable settlement out of court.
The British magistrates are called upon to decide
such trumpery questions that if a litigant were to
submit them to a Chinese tribunal the magistrate
would probably order him to be flogged for needlessly
stirring up litigious strife. By taking cognisance
of the simplest village disputes it may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
that we are gradually weakening the solidarity of
the village organisation, which, if once destroyed,
can never be restored; and we are possibly storing
up a good deal of trouble for the Chinese officials
who will resume their functions in Weihaiwei on
the expiry of our lease.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHINESE ART AND MUSIC</div>

<p>If the high development of literary and artistic
tastes is to be taken as a criterion of civilisation
it is not likely that even in this respect Europe
has much cause to throw contemptuous glances at
China. But many of those European collectors
who admire and are willing to pay enormous prices
for specimens of Chinese porcelain<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">404</a>&mdash;much of it
stolen from private houses in Peking and elsewhere&mdash;are
perhaps not aware of the high standard which
Chinese artists have reached in other directions.
Fine examples of their pictorial art are still not
very numerous in Europe, or at least are not
easily accessible to the public, though the British
Museum contains, among other Chinese drawings
and paintings, characteristic sketches by such famous
artists as Lin Liang of the Ming dynasty. But the
rapidity with which the art of Japan has gained the
admiration of Europe is proof enough that Chinese
art&mdash;to which that of Japan owes its most characteristic
qualities and nearly all its inspiration&mdash;will
some day arouse no less enthusiasm among the
art critics of Europe. An English critic, who is
also a poet&mdash;Mr Laurence Binyon&mdash;says of the
landscape painting of the Sung dynasty (the tenth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
to the thirteenth centuries of our era) that "not till
the nineteenth century in Europe do we find anything
like the landscape art of China in the Sung
period,&mdash;a disinterested love of beauty in nature for
its own sake, regardless of associations imposed by
the struggles of existence.... To the Sung artists
and poets, mountains were a passion, as to Wordsworth.
The landscape art thus founded, and continued
by the Japanese in the fifteenth century,
must rank as the greatest school of landscape which
the world has seen."<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">405</a> In art, as in literature and
politics, the great days of China lie in the past, but
there are probably more artists at work at the
present day in China than anywhere else, and the
zeal and enthusiasm with which they execute their
best work&mdash;generally without any expectation of
material reward&mdash;is a sure indication that the
artistic sense of the Chinese is still full of vigorous
vitality, and may lead to great results in the future.</p>

<p>In music it must be admitted that China lags
as yet far behind Europe. It has been reported
of one of the foremost pianists and composers of
the present day that when he visited California and
heard Chinese music for the first time, he volunteered
the opinion that "it really was music," a
truth which some of us perhaps might be inclined
to doubt. If an intelligent Chinese who had never
before been outside his own country were taken
without previous instruction to the performance
of an Italian opera, or had the privilege of
hearing the <i lang="la">Agnus Dei</i> of Mozart's 1st Mass or
Meyerbeer's <i lang="la">Qui in manu Dei requiescit</i> as sung,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
for example, in Magdalen College Chapel, he
would be merely puzzled. The music would be
devoid of meaning to him, and he would probably
regard it as unintelligible noise. Yet, after all,
a musical ear&mdash;apart from the almost universal
liking for simple melody&mdash;is by no means too
common even in Europe, and an average Englishman
would repudiate the idea that he was less
civilised or less highly evolved than a German
because he had less appreciation of the wonders
of harmony. Time was&mdash;not so very long ago&mdash;when
Wagner's music was regarded in England
as a kind of joke; and few people are really able
to understand and appreciate the grandest music
of the nineteenth century&mdash;though they often
think they do&mdash;without some previous training.
Some are even frank enough to confess that it
bores them, much as it would bore a man who
did not understand Greek to listen to a reading
from Sophocles. But are the Chinese capable of
being musically trained? Judging from a few
cases within my own knowledge, I am inclined
to think they are. But in any case we should
remember that music as we understand it is the
youngest of the arts, and time only can show
whether all the great music of the future is to
be exclusively a Western product.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LITERATURE</div>

<p>As regards literature, the difficulty of the
Chinese written language has no doubt stood in
the way of spreading a knowledge of the Chinese
masterpieces in Europe, and most of the translations
that exist are&mdash;even when verbally exact&mdash;far
from reproducing the spirit of the original.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
The probability is that in future the best translations
will come from the pens of native scholars.
Mr Ku Hung-Ming,<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">406</a> graduate of a Scottish
university, has rendered good service to Europe
in giving us what are perhaps the best existing
English translations of a portion of the Confucian
classics. Yet the ignorance still shown even by
European residents in China of the extent and
richness of Chinese literature is very remarkable.
Some time ago, in conversation with an Englishman
who had lived many years in China, I
happened to allude to the works of one of the
most famous of Chinese poets. My friend had
never heard his name, and was surprised to learn
that China had any poets at all. Professor Giles,
with his happy gift of apt translation and paraphrase,
has turned into good English verse<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">407</a> a few
short specimens of the beautiful poetry of the
T'ang and Sung dynasties, and the contents
of his little volume must have surprised some
Western readers who had little idea that while
the Mercians and West Saxons were still struggling
for supremacy in England under their Ecgberhts
and Beorhtrics, such exquisite flowers of poesy
were springing up on the soil of distant China.
Yet the translations that have already appeared
in foreign languages are but a trifle compared
with the wealth of poetry that still remains
unknown to Europe; and Chinese poetry, like
that of all other languages, loses half its
beauty when clothed in the words of an alien<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
tongue. A Chinese gentleman's education is not
regarded as complete if he cannot clothe his
ideas in graceful verse; nor does he, like the
English schoolboy who seldom meddles with
Latin hexameters and Greek iambics when his
education is "finished," neglect this pleasant
accomplishment when he has left the halls of
learning. Such poetry, naturally, is rarely of a
high order; but though the published poetry of
the present day is poor compared with that of
the past&mdash;even in England we have not always
with us singers of the Elizabethan standard&mdash;the
great poets of China are still quoted and read
with the same appreciation as of old. That real
poetic feeling is far from extinct may be seen by
any English reader who peruses Mr C. Clementi's
translation of the Cantonese Love-songs,<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">408</a> which
are quite modern. The genius of Chinese poetry
tends to be elegiac and idyllic. It is seldom or
never intensely lyrical, even when it is intended for
a musical accompaniment, like the love-songs just
referred to. But if Chinese literature can boast of
no Shelleys or Swinburnes, there are many writers
whose poems may well be compared with the best
work of our English elegiac and descriptive poets,
such as Gray. It must, I think, be admitted that
the Chinese language is not the most perfect existing
vehicle for poetical expression. We need
only take a single test-line from Homer&mdash;say
line 198 of <cite>Odyssey</cite> xi.,&mdash;or a couplet from
Shelley&mdash;say lines 5 and 6 of the third stanza of
<cite>The Question</cite>,&mdash;to realise a rhythmical music and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
movement of which the Chinese language is, I
fear, incapable; yet the words used by Lafcadio
Hearn to describe the best Japanese poetry may
with equal justice be applied to the idyllic poetry
of China: "compositions which, with a few chosen
syllables only, can either create a perfect coloured
picture in the mind, or bestir the finest sensations
of memory with marvellous penetrative delicacy."<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">409</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">EUROPEAN ATTITUDE</div>

<p>All that I have said of the amenities of Chinese
civilisation will no doubt bewilder some readers
who have never visited the country and who never
think of China unless it happens to figure conspicuously
in the newspapers in connection with
wars and massacres. They have had detailed
accounts of how ruffianly hordes of cut-throats
tried to exterminate the Europeans in the legations
at Peking, and every now and then they hear of
the brutal murder of a missionary and his family.
But does it never occur to them to ask what has
led to such outbreaks? Surely these murders and
outrages are not committed from sheer love of
blood and slaughter? If such frenzied attacks
are made from time to time upon foreigners,
surely they cannot result from a mere loathing
of fellow human beings who happen to belong to
a Western land? It is well to seek information
on such points, for the questioner may rest assured
that the fault has not always been on the side
of China, that these ebullitions of frenzy do not
spring from mere wild barbarism, and that a real
or fancied wrong is invariably at their root. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
the Chinese are as keen as the proudest race in
Europe to resent insult or injustice. It is no
doubt true that on occasions when the Chinese
find their own antiquated fighting implements
totally inadequate to enable them to meet on
equal terms the powerfully-armed and well-drilled
soldiers of Europe, they will then, in frenzy and
desperation, and stung with a sense of wrong, be
guilty of grave crimes against humanity, choosing
moments when their victims are few and
defenceless to strike them in the dark; but they
are not actuated by mere savagery and lust of
blood. Nor are they cowards. That they will
flee panic-stricken from a foe armed with the most
deadly modern weapons of precision, is true
enough: so would have fled the fathers of the
splendid heroes who recently beat the best soldiers
and sailors of one of the foremost Powers of
Europe, yet no one dares to assume that the
fathers of the Japanese soldiers of to-day were
cowards. Let us hesitate before we condemn the
Chinese as a cowardly race because they shrink
from facing odds which we Englishmen are never
called upon to face ourselves. Let us at least wait
till they have met us on equal terms, armed with
weapons as good as our own, and led by officers
trained in the art of war.<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">410</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">TREATMENT OF ORIENTALS</div>

<p>Many will excuse Western aggression in China
and in the Orient generally on many grounds:
even Kiaochou will have its apologists. But can
any fair-minded gentleman of England, Germany,
France or Russia say with perfect sincerity that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
the military Powers of Europe have behaved
chivalrously towards the East? Have they not
too often acted as bullies, too often taken advantage
of their brute strength? Even so, the apologists
may say, the methods of nations cannot
and must not be the same as those of individual
men. Conduct that the public-school boy would
denounce as caddish becomes statecraft and <i>la
haute politique</i> when nation deals with nation. Yet
is it not conceivable that if we treated the East
with the same chivalry and courtesy which the
well-bred English gentleman in private life shows
to those who are weaker or humbler than himself,
we might before many years are past find in China
a loyal and powerful friend instead of a possible
sullen and suspicious foe? It should never be
forgotten that the true Oriental&mdash;even more
than the Englishman bred at Winchester and
New College&mdash;is a firm believer in the truth
embodied in William of Wykeham's old motto,
<i>Manners makyth man</i>; and nothing is more certain
than that if we want China to welcome us as
teachers, as engineers, as builders of railways, as
merchants, as missionaries or as capitalists we
must approach her with frankness and courtesy,
not with professions of altruism covering only
greedy selfishness, not with the sinister motives
of Chaucer's "smyler with the knyf under the
cloke."</p>

<p>As far as British relations with China are concerned,
by far the brightest sign of the times is
the willingness of our Government to assist China
in stamping out the curse of opium&mdash;almost as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
great a curse as alcohol in our own country&mdash;and
in doing what in us lies to prevent the further
dismemberment of the empire. That this is a
policy which commends itself to all Englishmen
who have fairly considered the questions at issue,
I have very little doubt; but it is to be feared
that there will always be some who, from selfish
dread of losing some material advantage which
they hoped to gain from exploiting China, will
always be ready to urge a narrower policy. They
are indignant at the idea of the subjects of a
foreign Power obtaining any valuable concessions
or rights in England itself&mdash;as when the newspapers
report the acquisition of Welsh coal-fields
by a syndicate of Germans&mdash;yet they are intolerant
of the cry of "China for the Chinese."
Fortunately, the English Press of Hongkong
and Shanghai is generally very fair-minded in its
attitude towards international questions, and the
intelligent and sympathetic view which it has
taken of some of the recent regrettable episodes
in Anglo-Chinese relations at Shanghai and elsewhere
must go far towards broadening the ideas
of many of its readers. Yet too often, I am
afraid, the European in China almost prides himself
on the fact that he has no liking for or
sympathy with the Chinese; and those who are
convicted of showing such sympathy are as often
as not stigmatised as "pro-Chinese"&mdash;apparently
the worst offence of which any Englishman in
China can be guilty. In the treaty ports one
often hears the very foolish remark made, that
the acquisition of a scholarly knowledge of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
Chinese language and literature leads to a kind
of softening of the brain: "that way madness
lies." This attitude is analogous to that of the
modern man of business, who, having had only
a commercial or technical training himself, and
regarding all education merely as a means for
acquiring money and "getting on," scoffs at what
he knows nothing about, and ridicules those who
maintain the advantages of a study of Greek.
Without a knowledge of that language it cannot,
of course, be expected that they should take to
heart a valuable old warning:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>πᾶς τις ἀπαίδευτος φρονιμωτάτος ἐστὶ σιωπῶν.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote">THE AWAKENING OF CHINA</div>

<p>China has only recently begun to awake from
her old lethargy, and in her recent attempts to
assert her independence and to repudiate foreign
interference it must be admitted by her best friends
that she has already made some grievous and
foolish mistakes that may cost her dear. More
than one Western Power watches these mistakes
with sullen interest, sword in hand. It is to be
hoped for China's sake that the statesmen who
are to guide her fortunes during the next few
years&mdash;which will too probably be years of strife
and bloodshed&mdash;will not attempt to compress the
work of a century into a year; and it is to be
hoped that the great Western Powers for their
own sakes will show reasonable patience in dealing
with the blunders which in the course of so vast
a work as the readjustment of the social and
political forces of China must from time to time
be committed by her responsible leaders. Chinese
patriotism, for the first time since the history of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
European relations with China began, is becoming
a force to be reckoned with. Crude manifestations
of this patriotism have recently given rise to unfortunate
incidents and to acts which Europe and
America cannot be expected to sympathise with
or to admire; indeed, in some cases the West is
undoubtedly right in insisting that China should
show a proper respect for her treaty obligations.
But surely this is not the time to show selfish
hostility to the new hopes and ideals of a great
people who are struggling in the throes of
regeneration. The next fifteen years will probably
be decisive in determining the whole course
of China's future history. If wise statesmanship
brings her successfully through her present struggle
she need have no fear for the remoter future. She
will then be on the way to become one of the
greatest nations&mdash;perhaps the greatest&mdash;in the
world, and I know of little in her past history to
discourage the hope that she will use her great
powers for the good of mankind and the preservation
of the world's peace.<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">411</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MIDDLE KINGDOM</div>

<p>After all, it is only in recent years that we
have begun to realise how large the world is&mdash;a
curious fact when we consider how the advance of
science has tended to the annihilation of space.
The Roman empire and the <i lang="la">pax Romana</i> were of
such enormous importance for all the races that
now people Europe that we have hardly yet rid
ourselves of the old idea that the Romans at the
period of their widest dominion ruled the world;
yet we ought to know now that the Mediter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>ranean
"world" was only a fraction of our globe,
and by no means the only civilised fraction.
The Chinese called their country "The Middle
Kingdom," meaning that it was the centre from
which all civilisation and all light and learning
radiated. The countries outside China, when their
existence was known of at all, were regarded as
more or less civilised according as they were nearer
to or further removed from that brilliant centre.
Those that were altogether beyond the reach of
China's influence were outside civilisation; they
were countries on the fringe of the world, inhabited
by barbarians. Our own attitude has hitherto
been very much the same. We who have inherited,
more or less directly, the civilisation and
culture of Rome and Greece have for centuries
past regarded ourselves as "the world." When
we began to have relations with Eastern countries
we found that somehow or other we could not
make Oriental culture and civilisation quite fit in
with our preconceived notions of those things.
We regarded the East&mdash;especially China&mdash;with a
kind of mingled contempt and amusement. Even
to this day superficial writers cannot deny themselves
the pleasure of dwelling on what to their
minds are the oddities and absurdities of Chinese
life: and so we have humorous descriptions from
their pens of how everything in China is distorted
and "upside down"&mdash;the writers forgetting that
some of the salient features of our own civilisation
must be quite as ridiculous when looked at
from the Chinese standpoint. But the truth is,
of course, that neither Europe nor China has any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
right to regard the other as a subject for caricature.
The time has come when we should realise that
Europe and North America are not "the world";
that even the glorious heritage handed down to us
by Greece, of which we are so justly proud, did
not include everything that was worth having or
worth knowing; that we people of the West have
a monopoly neither in virtue nor in culture; and
that the Far East, as well as the Far West, has
inherited something of the wisdom of the ages.
When we have realised these things it may then
be possible for East and West to meet in friendship
and frankness instead of with mutual suspicion
or contempt, each ready to give the other something
of the best that it has inherited from its own
past. It may then be that we shall begin to trade
with China in something more than cottons and
silks, machinery and rifles; that a commerce will
be inaugurated of which political economy knows
nothing, in which customs tariffs will be unnecessary,
and in which sympathy and tolerance,
not money, will be the medium of exchange.</p>

<h3><a id="NOTE_1"></a>NOTE 1 (<a href="#Page_61">p. 61</a>)</h3>

<p class="center">MOUNT OMEI AND CHOU KUNG SHAN</p>

<p>There are vague traditions that Mount Omei was a centre
of primitive nature-worship long before the days of Buddhism.
There is a passage in the <cite>Shu Ching</cite> from which we learn that
the semi-mythical emperor Yü (about the twenty-third century
<span class="smcap">B.C.</span>), after the completion of some of the famous drainage and
irrigation works with which his name is associated, offered
sacrifices on (or to) certain hills named Ts'ai and Mêng. It is
a disputed point among the commentators where these hills are.
Mêng is said to be one of the mountains that overlook Ya-chou,
and we shall see in Chapter VIII. that one of those mountains
is still the resort of pilgrims. As to Ts'ai, one commentator
at least has inclined to the opinion that it must be looked
for in the Omei range (see Legge's <cite>Chinese Classics</cite>, vol. iii.
part i. p. 121). If this identification be correct, we must regard
the brief notice in the <cite>Shu Ching</cite> as the oldest reference in
extant literature to Mount Omei. The student of Chinese who
wishes to pursue further the vexed question of Mêng and Ts'ai
will find a discussion of it in the 16th <cite>chüan</cite> of the <cite>Ssuch'uan
T'ung Chih</cite>. The probability seems to be that both Mêng and
Ts'ai were close to Ya-chou, and that neither of them should
be identified with Omei. Mêng seems to be one of the hills that
lie to the south of the city; Ts'ai may or may not be the somewhat
famous mountain generally known as Chou Kung Shan, or
the Hill of Duke Chou, which is situated a couple of miles to
the east. Chou Kung, who is said to have died in <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 1105,
is perhaps chiefly known to Europeans as the legendary inventor
of the famous "south-pointing chariot," but he is regarded by
the Chinese as a pattern of many virtues. His zeal for the
public good was so great that he seems&mdash;if we may believe
Mencius&mdash;to have anticipated the all-night sittings of the
House of Commons. His merits indeed were of so extraordinary
a nature that, as we know from the <cite>Lun Yü</cite>, Confucius regarded
it as a sign of his approaching dotage that for a long time he
had ceased to dream of Chou Kung.</p>

<p>Other people besides Confucius were in the habit of dreaming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
of this great and good man. The hill near Ya-chou, according
to a story preserved in the official annals of Ssuch'uan, owes its
name to a dream-vision that came to the famous Chinese general,
Chu-ko Liang. This distinguished warrior flourished in the
second and third centuries of our era. He made his name by
his successful campaigns against the Wild Men of the West&mdash;the
Man-tzŭ and others&mdash;and on one occasion when he was
proceeding at the head of his army to inflict chastisement
upon them he spent a night on the slopes of the Ya-chou Hill
and dreamed that Chou Kung paid him a visit. He regarded
this as of such happy omen for the success of his expedition that
he immediately caused a temple to Chou Kung to be erected on
the auspicious spot. Since that time, the hill&mdash;which may or
may not have been already sacred, under the name of Ts'ai,
to the memory of the Emperor Yü&mdash;has always been known as
Chou Kung Shan. The fame of the general Chu-ko Liang has
almost rivalled that of Chou Kung himself. This "darling hero
of the Chinese people," as Professor Giles calls him, has had
temples erected in his honour in many towns of Ssuch'uan,
and he is a well-known and popular figure on the Chinese
theatrical stage.</p>

<p class="center">BODHIDARMA</p>

<p>Bodhidarma (<span lang="cmn-Hant">逹摩大師</span>) is the original of the <cite>Ta Mo</cite> so
often found in Ssuch'uanese temples. Catholic missionaries,
struck by the sound of the name and the fact that Ta-Mo is
sometimes found wearing an ornament shaped like a Christian
cross, have clung to the idea that Ta-Mo was no other than the
Apostle St Thomas. (See <cite>Croix et Swastika</cite>, by Father Gaillard,
pp. 80 <i>seq.</i>) Bodhidarma is regarded as the founder of the Zen
sect in Japan. Japanese children know him well, for he is a
conspicuous object in the toy-shops in the form of the legless
Daruma. (See Lafcadio Hearn's charming essay in <cite>A Japanese
Miscellany</cite>.)</p>

<p class="center">"GODS" IN BUDDHISM</p>

<div class="sidenote">NIRVANA</div>

<p>On this subject may be consulted the passage on the
"Eel-wrigglers" in the Brahma-gâla Suttanta, translated by
Rhys Davids in the <cite>Sacred Books of the Buddhists</cite>, vol. ii.
Buddhism refrains from denying, rather than distinctly affirms,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
the existence of the Brahmanical gods; but these gods, if existent,
are regarded as neither omnipotent nor immortal. They are
subject to the law of karma just as man himself is subject. The
Arahat is greater than any "god" because released from all
change and illusion, to which the "gods" are still subject.
(See Rhys Davids, <cite>Hibbert Lectures</cite>, pp. 210 <i>seq.</i>, 4th edn.) The
abolition or retention of the Brahmanical deities would really
make little or no difference to the philosophical position of
canonical Buddhism.</p>


<h3><a id="NOTE_4"></a>NOTE 4 (<a href="#Page_71">p. 71</a>)</h3>

<p class="center">NIRVANA</p>

<p>The view of Nirvana set forth in the text is that taught
by Professor Rhys Davids, the veteran scholar to whom all
European students of Buddhism owe so deep a debt of gratitude.
(See his <cite>Buddhism</cite>, <cite>Hibbert Lectures</cite>, <cite>American Lectures</cite>, and
his valuable contributions to the <cite>Sacred Books of the East</cite>.
With regard to Nirvana, see especially his <cite>Questions of King
Milinda</cite>, vol. i. pp. 106-108 and vol. ii. pp. 181 <i>seq.</i>) As regards
the <i lang="sa">tanha</i> or "thirst" for existence, which according to the
Buddhist theory keeps us in the net of illusion and prevents
the attainment of Nirvana, Huxley (<cite>Evolution and Ethics</cite>)
mentions as a curious fact that a parallel may be found in the
<cite>aviditas vitae</cite> of Stoicism.</p>

<p>The Japanese views of Nirvana are set forth clearly and
authoritatively in Fujishima's <cite>Le Bouddhisme Japonais</cite>. "Selon
les écoles du Mahâyâna, ce qui est vide au dedans et au dehors
c'est l'existence composée et visible (<i lang="sa">samkrita</i>): l'anéantissement
de ce vide n'est donc pas lui-même le vide, mais plutôt la
plénitude." The author goes on to quote from a sutra which
declares that "illusion passes away; reality remains; that is
Nirvana." To an English reader this naturally recalls some of
Shelley's lines in <cite>Adonais</cite>, too well known to quote. Japanese
Buddhism has, of course, developed somewhat on lines of its
own. The popular Buddhism of Japan is portrayed with rare
insight by Lafcadio Hearn, as in his <cite>Gleanings from Buddha-Fields</cite>,
pp. 211 <cite>seq.</cite></p>

<p>Among recent attempts to escape from the pessimistic conclusion
that, according to strict Buddhism, Arahatship must
lead after all to complete extinction, Schrader's interesting essay
in the <cite>Journal</cite> of the Pali Text Society, 1904-1905, is worth
consulting. The question is one of deep philosophic interest, but
a discussion of it cannot be attempted in the narrow space
at our disposal here.</p>

<p class="center">THE MAHAYANA</p>

<p>For explanations of the rise of the Mahayana, see (among
many other authorities) Max Mūller's <cite>India</cite>, p. 87 (1905 edn.)
and his <cite>Last Essays</cite> (First Series) pp. 260 <cite>seq.</cite> (Longmans: 1901);
see also p. 376 in R. Sewell's essay on <cite>Early Buddhist Symbolism</cite>
(J.R.A.S., July, 1886). For the growth of the Mahayana and
kindred schools in China, the works of Beal, Edkins, Eitel and
Watters are among the first that should be consulted. There
is still a great deal that is mysterious in the early history of
Mahayana and allied systems, and it is reasonable to hope that
the discoveries recently made, and still being made almost daily
by Stein and others in Chinese Turkestan and neighbouring
regions, will throw a flood of light on the whole subject, and
perhaps destroy many existing theories regarding the history
of Buddhism during the ten or twelve first centuries of the
Christian era.</p>


<h3><a id="NOTE_6"></a>NOTE 6 (<a href="#Page_86">p. 86</a>)</h3>

<p class="center">ANTIQUITIES OF MOUNT OMEI</p>

<p>As Baber's discovery of the <i lang="zh">chüan tien</i> or spiral-shaped brick
hall and the bronze elephant which it contains aroused very
natural enthusiasm among persons interested in Far Eastern
antiquities, and is still repeatedly referred to in connection with
Chinese archæology, it is with hesitation that I suggest a doubt
as to whether either the building or the elephant is as old as
Baber&mdash;and others after him&mdash;have supposed. (See <cite>Supplementary
Papers</cite>, R.G.S., vol. i. pp. 34-36, and Archibald Little's
<cite>Mount Omi and Beyond</cite>, pp. 64-5.)</p>

<p>In the 41st <cite>chüan</cite> of the <cite>Ssuch'uan T'ung Chih</cite> there are two
passages relating to the Wan-nien Ssŭ, and one of them Baber
apparently overlooked. It was written about 1665 in commemoration
of a restoration of the Wan-nien and Kuang Hsiang
monasteries under the auspices of a Provincial Governor. In it
occur some remarks of which the following is a rough translation.
"From the T'ang to the Sung dynasties the name of the
monastery was <i lang="zh">Pai Shui P'u Hsien Ssŭ</i>. In the time of Wan
Li of the Ming, its name was changed to <i lang="zh">Shêng-shou Wan-nien
Ssŭ</i>. As originally built (<i lang="zh">yüan chien</i>) it contained a <i lang="zh">tsang ching
ko</i> (<i>i.e.</i> a library) consisting of a revolving (circular?) spiral
structure of brick, strongly built, of exceptionally delicate workmanship,
very lofty and imposing, and of a beauty unsurpassed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
in the world." Now the existing <i lang="zh">tien</i> is a most curious building
of a foreign (probably Indian) type, but to describe it as lofty
and imposing and of delicate and elaborate workmanship would
be to spin a traveller's yarn of the baser sort. How, without
impugning the good faith of the chronicler, can we reconcile such
a glowing description with existing facts?</p>

<div class="sidenote">MOUNT OMEI</div>

<p>When we learn from the local records that the Wan-nien Ssŭ
has been several times destroyed by fire, the obvious supposition
is that the original splendid structure described in my quotation
perished with the rest of the monastic pile. Baber himself points
out that the tusks of the elephant inside the <i lang="zh">tien</i> are of late date,
the old ones having been "melted off," he was told, "by the
intense heat." It seems natural to suppose that when the rebuilding
of the monastery took place (and it was rebuilt, as we know,
late in the sixteenth or early in the seventeenth century, and again
about 1665) the monks had neither funds nor skill sufficient to
enable them to restore the <i lang="zh">chüan tien</i> to its pristine magnificence,
and contented themselves with putting up a much smaller and
meaner building, preserving as far as possible the original
peculiarities of design.</p>

<p>This, however, is mere supposition. I now return to our
Chinese authorities, and in the 9th <cite>chüan</cite> of the <cite>Omei-hsien
Chih</cite> I find an allusion to the Wan-nien Ssŭ by one Li Hua Nan
(<span lang="cmn-Hant">李化楠</span>), an official who apparently flourished in the
seventeenth century. He states most emphatically that the
monastery was restored or rebuilt in both the Sung and the
Ming periods, but had undergone such complete destruction by
fire that nothing was left <i>except a chüan tien belonging to the
period of Wan Li</i>. Wan Li was the reign-title of a Ming
emperor who reigned from 1573 to 1619. That the <i lang="zh">chüan tien</i>
was <i>carefully and thoroughly restored</i> under Wan Li is admitted
by the authority quoted by Baber himself: the only question
seems to be whether the restoration left enough of the original
building to justify our regarding it as a veritable monument
"fifteen centuries old"&mdash;as Baber conjectured&mdash;or whether, as
the evidence seems to indicate, the restoration was such that
we have only a small and inferior copy of "a lofty and imposing
building, of a beauty unsurpassed in the world."</p>

<p>No one, so far as I know, has yet drawn attention to the fact
that the spiral building of the Wan-nien Ssŭ is not&mdash;or was
not&mdash;the only building of its kind on Mount Omei. Among the
few monasteries on the lower slopes of the mountain which I did
not enter is the Hua Yen Ssŭ (not to be confused with the
temple of the Hua Yen Ting mentioned on page 91). It was not
till after I had left the province that I came across a description
of this monastery, which made me much regret that I had not
visited it. I translate the following passage from the <cite>Omei-Shan
Chih</cite> (quoted in the 41st <cite>chüan</cite> of the <cite>T'ung Chih</cite>): "There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
is a very ancient and wonderful revolving (circular?) spiral
building (<span lang="cmn-Hant">有旋螺殿極奇古</span>), and a tablet of the Shao
Hsing period of the Sung dynasty, on the left side of which are
carved the words '15 <i lang="zh">li</i> to Omei-hsien' and on the right the
words '70 <i lang="zh">li</i> to the summit of the mountain.'" The words
used to describe the shape of the "revolving spiral" building
are identical&mdash;so far as they go&mdash;with those applied to the brick
edifice in the Wan-nien Ssŭ: and the whole passage certainly
implies that, whatever the date of the spiral building in the Hua
Yen Ssŭ might be, it was at any rate prior to the Sung dynasty.
The next visitor to Mount Omei should not fail to examine the
curiosities of the Hua Yen Ssŭ; a close inspection of its spiral
building&mdash;if it still exists&mdash;and a comparison of it with that of
the Wan-nien Ssŭ might assist us in assigning a date to the
latter, and might perhaps prove that however old the latter may
be it is not without a rival in mere antiquity.</p>

<p>So much for the brick building. What is to be said about
the bronze elephant that Baber so properly admired, and which
he believed to be "the most ancient bronze casting of any great
size in existence"?</p>

<p>Li Hua Nan, the writer who ascribes the <i lang="zh">chüan tien</i> to the
Wan Li period, goes on to add a piece of information which is
much to our purpose. "There is a P'u Hsien 1 <i lang="zh">chang</i> 6 <i lang="zh">ch'ih</i> in
height, with a gilded body, riding a bronze elephant, set up
in the <i>Jên Tsung period of the Sung dynasty</i>." The sentence
is somewhat ambiguous, for the date might refer to the image
of P'u Hsien only and not to the elephant. Baber believed, on
artistic grounds, that the P'u Hsien was of much later date than
the elephant. On the whole, however, it seems probable that
Li Hua Nan referred to both images. The Jên Tsung reign
lasted from 1023 to 1063, so that if we select the middle of the
period we may assign the elephant approximately to the year
1043. This cuts many centuries off the age of the elephant as
reckoned by Baber.</p>

<p>There is no reason for doubting whether so fine a bronze
casting of an animal unknown to China could have been made
as late as the eleventh century. There were still Buddhists in
India at that time, and Chinese pilgrims had not yet given up
the habit of visiting India in search of relics and <i lang="zh">pei to yeh</i>
(palm-leaf manuscripts). Indian Buddhists, too, frequently came
to Mount Omei. There is, indeed, no necessity for mere guesswork,
for the monastic and provincial records contain ample
evidence that the casting of large bronzes for Buddhist shrines
was, during the Sung period at least, a regular industry in the
city of Ch'êng-tu.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BUDDHA'S TEETH</div>

<p>The numerous miniature "Buddhas" that line the walls of
the present <i lang="zh">chüan tien</i> have attracted the attention of several
European visitors, and perhaps deserve a few words of comment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span>
Some are the property of pilgrims who leave them in the holy
building in order that they may acquire sanctity, but the greater
number are evidently antique and seem to be of uniform pattern.
Baber was informed that they were of silver&mdash;darkened with age
and the smoke of incense. Mr Archibald Little says they are
of bronze. I made my own enquiries on the matter and was
assured by the monks that they were of iron. Where did they
come from? I conjecture that they are the images that once
adorned a vanished hall of the Wan-nien Ssŭ, known as the
<i lang="zh">San Ch'ien T'ieh Fo Tien</i>&mdash;Pavilion of the Three Thousand Iron
Buddhas. I cannot find any history of this building, but from
a poem by Ku Kuang Hsü, a Ssuch'uan chief justice of the
Ming dynasty, I gather that it was remembered but had disappeared
by his time. It existed in the Sung dynasty, for it
is mentioned by one Fan Ch'êng Ta (<span lang="cmn-Hant">范成大</span>) who visited
it during that period. The number of the images is easily
explained as an allusion to the three thousand disciples who are
said to have sat at the feet of P'u Hsien in the days when,
according to the legend, that great Bodhisattva expounded the
Good Law amid the forests of Mount Omei.</p>

<p class="center">"BUDDHA'S TEETH"</p>

<p>The most famous of the supposed teeth of Buddha is, of course,
the celebrated relic preserved in Kandy. The Buddhists of
Ceylon will have none of the story that the original tooth was
ground into powder by a pious Portuguese archbishop of the
sixteenth century, and they firmly believe that the genuine relic
still reposes in Kandy at the Malagawa Vihara. China possesses,
or is supposed to possess, several of the alleged Buddha's teeth,
but they seem to have acquired no more than a local reputation.
One&mdash;similar in appearance to that of Mount Omei&mdash;is described
by Fortune as being in possession of a monastery at Fu-chou.
A writer in the <cite>Fan Ju Tzŭ Chi</cite> (<span lang="cmn-Hant">范汝梓記</span>), commenting
upon the specimen in the Wan-nien Ssŭ, remarks that it weighs
15 catties, equivalent to about 20 lbs. He says that in the
Ching Yin (<span lang="cmn-Hant">淨因寺</span>) in Ch'êng-tu there is one that weighs
3-1/3 lbs., and another in the Chao Chiao Ssŭ (<span lang="cmn-Hant">昭覺寺</span>) in the
same city that weighs 9-1/2 lbs. He goes on to describe a far
more remarkable specimen that had the singular property of
producing out of its own substance myriads of other <i lang="zh">shê li</i> or
Buddhistic relics, some of which flew off into space while others
fell on the floor and knocked against the furniture with a jingling
sound. This surprising tooth appeared by special command<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
before the emperor, but we are not informed whether the <i lang="fr">séance</i>
was a successful one. Our historian shows something of a
tendency to indulge in frivolous speculations regarding the
capacity and measurements of the mouth that could accommodate
teeth of such monstrous sizes and singular properties,
and he points out that according to tradition a true Buddha's
tooth is always marked with certain sacred symbols, such as the
<i lang="sa">dharma chakra</i> or Wheel of the Law.</p>

<p>Marco Polo mentions a great embassy sent by the emperor
of China to Ceylon in 1284 for the purpose of obtaining certain
relics of "our first father Adam," such as his hair and teeth
and a dish from which he ate; and he remarks that the
ambassadors, besides acquiring the dish, which was of "very
beautiful green porphyry," and some of the hair, "also succeeded
in getting two of the grinder teeth, which were passing great and
thick." It need hardly be said that the monarchs of the Yüan
dynasty took a very considerable interest in Buddha, but none
at all in "our first father Adam." That they sent embassies
to Ceylon for Buddhist relics is probably true, for the fact is
mentioned in Chinese Chronicles; but it is impossible to say
whether any of the numerous "teeth of Buddha" that have
appeared in different localities in China formed part of the relics
then brought from Ceylon. (The notes appended to Cordier's
edition of Yule's <cite>Marco Polo</cite>, vol. ii. chap. xv., should be consulted
by all interested in the subject of the migrations of
Buddhist relics.)</p>

<p class="center">THE HSIEN TSU TIEN, CHUNG FÊNG SSŬ AND TA O SSŬ</p>

<p>The <i lang="zh">Hsien Tsu Tien</i> represents the earliest of the Mount
Omei monasteries, and is said to have been built by P'u Kung
in the reign of Ming Ti of the Han dynasty after the famous
episode of the lily-footed deer. Probably if the searchlight of
strict historical enquiry were to be turned on the legends and
records of Mount Omei, it would be found that the mountain
knew nothing of Buddhism until the third or fourth centuries
of our era. It is a significant fact that some of the legends
about P'u Kung&mdash;the herb-gathering official who followed the
deer and first saw the "Glory"&mdash;state or imply that he belonged
to the Chin period, which did not begin till the year 265.
There is more than a likelihood that the historians of such
ancient monasteries as the Hsien Tsu Tien and the Wan-nien
Ssŭ deliberately ante-dated their foundation in order to throw
back the beginnings of Omei's Buddhistic history to the earliest
possible period. It is almost inconceivable that Omei can have
become the resort of Buddhist monks during the very reign of
the emperor who is credited with the first introduction of
Buddhism into China.</p>

<p>According to the monastic chronicles, the earliest name of
the monastery we are considering was P'u Kaung Tien, "The
Pavilion of Universal Glory." The name was subsequently
altered to Kuang Hsiang Ssŭ (<span lang="cmn-Hant">光相寺</span>), and so it was known
during the T'ang and Sung periods. In the time of Hung Wu,
first emperor of the Ming, it was rebuilt and roofed with iron.
Associated with it were four small bronze pagodas, some of the
remains of which are still lying on the ground within the
precincts of the present Chin Tien (which was apparently first
built in the reign of Wan Li of the Ming). A thorough
restoration&mdash;carried out during a period of three years&mdash;took
place in the second half of the fifteenth century. At the end of
the Ming period it was utterly destroyed&mdash;presumably by fire.
It was again rebuilt during the reign of K'ang Hsi of the
present dynasty under the auspices of a Provincial Governor
named Chang (see<a href="#NOTE_6"> note 6</a>, paragraph 2), and minor restorations
on a smaller scale have taken place more recently.</p>

<p>The <i lang="zh">Chung Fêng Ssŭ</i> or Half-way Monastery bears the
alternative name of "The Gathering Clouds," an allusion to
the fact that here the upward-bound pilgrim enters into the
region of mist. It dates from the Chin dynasty (about the
third century of our era) and was restored in the Sung and
Ming periods.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TA HSIANG LING</div>

houses on the mountain, and has a finer site than most of its
rivals. An alternative name is Fu Shou An. This name is
due to the fact that the words Fu Shou&mdash;"Happiness and
Longevity"&mdash;were carved on a neighbouring rock by a celebrated
recluse of the Sung dynasty named Hsi I, known as
the Wizard of Omei.</p>

<p class="center">THE TA HSIANG LING</p>

<p>There is a small unsettled controversy regarding the name of
the Ta Hsiang Ling. It is possible that the mountain owes its
name not to the legend of P'u Hsien's elephant, but to the
famous general Chu-ko Liang (see <a href="#NOTE_1">note 1</a>). Devout Buddhists
are bound to hold that the name means "The Great Elephant,"
and this is the view taken in all Buddhistic accounts of western
Ssuch'uan and in the maps issued by the monks of Mount Omei.
But other authorities&mdash;including the official <i>Topography</i> and the
<i lang="zh">Shêng Wu Chi</i> (5th <i lang="zh">chüan</i>)&mdash;give the central character not as
<span lang="cmn-Hant">象</span> (<i lang="zh">hsiang</i>, elephant) but as <span lang="cmn-Hant">相</span> (<i lang="zh">hsiang</i>, minister of state),
thereby changing the mountain's name into "The Great
Mountain of the Minister." This minister is none other than
Chu-ko Liang, who is said to have crossed the mountain during
his western campaigns. The "Small Elephant Pass" in the
Chien-ch'ang Valley is similarly metamorphosed into "The
Small Mountain of the Minister," and for a like reason. This
latter mountain, however, is also known officially as the Nan
Shan or South Mountain. (<span lang="cmn-Hant">寕遠府南山土名小相嶺皆以武候經過得名</span>: <i lang="zh">Shêng Wu Chi</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>)</p>

<p>It may be worth mentioning that a neighbouring mountain
bears the officially-recognised name of Shih-tzŭ Shan, or Lion
Hill, but the <cite>T'ung Chih</cite> explicitly states that this is owing to
its peculiar shape. There is nothing in the contour of the Ta
Hsiang Ling to suggest an elephant.</p>

<p class="center">LU TING BRIDGE</p>

<p>The <cite>Ssuch'uan T'ung Chih</cite> makes the following remark in
connection with the suspension bridge at Lu Ting. "Formerly
there was no bridge. The waters of the river are swift and
turbulent, and boats and oars cannot be used. Travellers used
to cross by hanging on to a rope stretched across the river&mdash;a
dangerous proceeding." (We shall see, when we come to the
Yalung, that rope bridges are still in use.) In the fortieth year
of K'ang Hsi (1701) it was decided with imperial sanction to
construct an iron suspension bridge, not merely for the convenience
of travellers to and from Tibet, but also to facilitate
the military operations which during the reigns of K'ang Hsi,
Yung Chêng and Ch'ien Lung were carried on with great vigour
against the Tibetan tribes. The bridge is accurately described
in the <cite>Chih</cite> and in the <cite>Hsi Tsang Tu K'as</cite> as being 31 <i lang="zh">chang</i>
1 <i lang="zh">ch'ih</i> in length and 9 <i lang="zh">ch'ih</i> broad, and as possessing 9 chain-cables
supporting wooden planks, and side-railings of cast-iron.
A <i lang="zh">chang</i> is 11-3/4 English feet, and a <i lang="zh">ch'ih</i> about 14-1/10 English
inches. The bridge is similar in construction to those that
span the Mekong, Salwen and other rivers in Yunnan. They
are remarkable examples of Chinese engineering skill, and never
fail to astonish European travellers who behold them for the
first time.</p>

<p>The completion of the Lu Ting bridge seems to have had
a considerable moral effect on the border tribes, for the <cite>Chih</cite>
contains the names of dozens of <i lang="zh">t'u ssŭ</i> (tribal chiefs) who
immediately afterwards submitted to Chinese overlordship and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span>
consented to pay tribute. The more remote chiefs came in later,
but most of those in the neighbourhood of the road to Tachienlu
and the Ta Tu River hastened to become vassals of China during
the five first years of the eighteenth century. The vassalage
consisted&mdash;and for the most part still consists&mdash;merely in the
payment of a small annual tribute. But the chiefs of the Greater
and the Smaller Chin Ch'uan&mdash;the country that includes the
valley of the Ta Tu and its branches above Wa Ssŭ Kou&mdash;resisted
Chinese encroachments for many years in a most vigorous
and courageous manner, and it was not till the reign of Ch'ien
Lung, towards the end of the century, that the resistance of
the last Chin Ch'uan <i>roitelet</i> was finally quelled&mdash;with the
usual accompaniments of slaughter and devastation. Even as
it was, the Chinese owed their ultimate success more to the
assistance rendered them by other tribal chiefs&mdash;of whom the
Ming Chêng Ssŭ or King of Chala was the most important&mdash;than
to their own military skill. The war is well described&mdash;though
from an exclusively Chinese standpoint&mdash;in the <cite>Shêng Wu Chi</cite>
(<span lang="cmn-Hant">聖武記</span>).</p>

<p class="center">TACHIENLU</p>

<p>The Chinese characters (see <a href="#APPENDIX_B_ITINERARY">Itinerary</a>) used for the name
Tachienlu are three separate words signifying <i>strike</i>, <i>arrow</i>,
<i>forge</i>. These characters were originally chosen merely to
represent the sound of the Tibetan name Tar-rTse-Mto or
Dartsendo (derived from the names of the streams that meet
there), but Chinese archæologists contrived to forget this and
insisted upon finding an interpretation of the word that would
suit the meaning of the three Chinese characters. Accordingly
they constructed an ingenious legend to the effect that the
famous Chu-ko Liang&mdash;always as useful in literary as he used
to be in military emergencies&mdash;came to Tachienlu in the third
century of our era, and ordered his lieutenant, Kuo Ta, to forge
arrow-heads there for the imperial army. The actual forge is
said to have been in a cave on a hill at a short distance to
the north-east of the city. The proof of the absolute truth
of this story consists in the incontrovertible fact that the hill
in question is called the Kuo Ta hill to this day, and there
is a cave in it. The story is further embellished by the statement
that when the forge was in use a blue-black ram ran
round the hill and frightened away the barbarians (<i lang="zh">i jên</i>) so
that the good work could proceed without interruption.</p>

<h3><a id="NOTE_22"></a>NOTE 22 (<a href="#Page_136">p. 136</a>)</h3>

<p class="center">THE KING OF CHALA</p>

<p>Tachienlu is not a correct name for the state as a whole:
it is strictly applicable only to the city. The state may be
described as Chala or as Ming Chêng. Ming Chêng (<span lang="cmn-Hant">明正</span>)
corresponds with the Chinese title of the king&mdash;Ming Chêng Ssŭ
(<span lang="cmn-Hant">明正司</span>)&mdash;which was conferred upon an ancestor no less than
five hundred years ago. The meaning of the Chinese words&mdash;"bright"
and "correct"&mdash;are of no consequence. The word
"Chala" we have already discussed on page 136.</p>

<p>The king's Chinese rank is that of a <i lang="zh">hsüan wei shih ssŭ</i>
(<span lang="cmn-Hant">宣慰使司</span>)&mdash;one of the numerous titles invented by the
Chinese for their vassal chiefs. This title carries with it the
Chinese rank 3b. As a <i lang="zh">hsüan wei shih ssŭ</i> the king of Chala
takes precedence of the chiefs of Litang and Batang, his
neighbours on the west, both of whom are <i lang="zh">hsüan fu shih ssŭ</i>
(<span lang="cmn-Hant">宣撫使司</span>) with Chinese rank 4b. All three take
precedence of the ruler of Muli, who is an <i lang="zh">an fu shih ssŭ</i>
(<span lang="cmn-Hant">安撫使司</span>), with rank 5b. (For an explanation of these
titles and ranks, see Mayers' <cite>Chinese Government</cite>, 3rd edn.,
pp. 46-47. The Chinese official hierarchy consists of nine
ranks, subdivided into a higher and a lower grade, or <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>.)
Special decorations may be and often are conferred upon an
individual chief, and these may carry with them the "button"
of a superior rank: the button and its privileges, however, are
not hereditary. The rank of the chiefs <i lang="la">quâ</i> Chinese officials
does not affect their position <i lang="la">quâ</i> rulers of native states. The
"kings" of Litang, Batang and Muli are within their own
borders quite as powerful as the "king" of Chala. The latter,
however, holds his kingship by strict hereditary right, whereas
the "regalities" of Litang and Batang are not necessarily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span>
hereditary, though in practice they may be generally so. The
kingship of Muli is hereditary in one family (see <a href="#Page_215">Page 215</a>),
but as the king is also a lama, and therefore a celibate, the
descent can only be collateral.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that there are many other semi-independent
kings and chiefs along the borderland of Burma,
Tibet, Turkestan and Mongolia. Some are the vassals of
China, others the vassals of Tibet, while there are probably
some even to-day who pay no tribute and acknowledge no
suzerain. Few of these chiefs, however, have the importance
and dignity of those mentioned in this note.</p>

<p>The greatest length of the state of Chala, from Rumi-changu
on the north, to Lo Jang and Muli on the south, is 1,050 <i lang="zh">li</i> (say
350 miles); the greatest breadth, from Lu Ting on the east, to
the Yalung on the west, 400 <i lang="zh">li</i> (say 133 miles). Under the
king's control are 49 sub-chiefs, including 1 <i lang="zh">t'u ch'ien hu</i>
(<span lang="cmn-Hant">土千戶</span>) and 48 <i lang="zh">t'u pai hu</i> (<span lang="cmn-Hant">土百戶</span>). A <i lang="zh">t'u ch'ien hu</i>
nominally presides over 1,000 households, a <i lang="zh">t'u pai hu</i> over 100.
These terms, however, are quite elastic in meaning. The former
takes precedence of the latter, but he does not necessarily control
a wider territory, or a larger population. The population of the
whole state&mdash;not including Tachienlu&mdash;consists of 6,591 households.
(This is the figure given in the <cite>Ssuch'uan T'ung Chih</cite>,
the latest edition of which belongs to the nineteenth century.)
The number seems a small one, but a Tibetan household&mdash;the
members of which are all farm-hands or herdsmen&mdash;is generally
large, though the average family is so small that the population
of Chinese Tibet is probably&mdash;apart from Chinese immigration&mdash;at
the present time stationary. The annual tribute payable to
China by the king himself amounts to 161 taels 7 candareens&mdash;a
sum which, according to our reckoning, amounts to about £25.
His 49 sub-chiefs or headmen pay between them a further
tribute of about 180 taels 9 mace 2 candareens&mdash;equivalent to
about £27. The total revenue raised by China out of this
large tract of country is, therefore, only slightly over £50 a
year. But this amount was assessed at a time when the tael
was worth far more than it is worth now, and its purchasing
power in the Tibetan states is in any case considerably greater
than in the east of China; moreover, the money is not, strictly
speaking, a tax, but a mere acknowledgment of China's
suzerainty. <i>Ula</i> (see <a href="#Page_136">pp. 136-137</a>) is the real tax paid to China
by the tributary states of the west, and China exacts it in case
of need to the grim uttermost. Over and above the exaction
of <i>ula</i> and the payment of tribute the people are, of course,
obliged to pay taxes to the king himself. The king's powers
in the matter of taxation appear to be unlimited, for the
principle of "no taxation without representation" has not yet
been accepted as a political axiom in the state of Chala. But the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span>
only direct tax consists of a kind of <i>likin</i>, or toll on merchandise
in transit; this is ample to defray the cost of administration,
and the king's private exchequer is apparently chiefly dependent
for its supplies on the revenues of his hereditary property, which
are very considerable. The king of Chala succeeds in doing
what the kings of England used at one time to get into serious
trouble for not doing&mdash;he "lives of his own."</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE KING OF CHALA</div>

<p>The position of the <i lang="zh">t'u ch'ien hu</i> and <i lang="zh">t'u pai hu</i> is a peculiar
one. Though they are under the jurisdiction of the king, they
may be regarded as possessing a certain amount of independence.
The <i lang="zh">Ssuch'uan T'ung Chih</i> states that the king became a vassal
of China in the year 1666, but his <i lang="zh">t'u ch'ien hu</i> did not follow
suit till 1700, while the 48 <i lang="zh">t'u pai hu</i> all "came in" together
in 1701 (the fortieth year of K'ang Hsi). The Suzerain Power,
however, is careful to differentiate between the great vassals
and the little ones: the king of Chala&mdash;like others of his rank&mdash;receives,
in return for his homage, sealed "letters of authority"
and a stamped warrant; each <i lang="zh">t'u pai hu</i> receives only the
warrant. All these formalities are of small practical consequence:
the Chinese insist upon controlling the high-road to
Lhasa, and upon receiving their just dues in the shape of
<i>ula</i> service and tribute, but otherwise the kings and <i lang="zh">t'u pai
hu</i> of the western border are just as free as they were before
they "tied their heads"&mdash;as the Tibetan saying goes&mdash;to the
emperor of China. It may be worth while adding that the
king of Chala is expected to prostrate himself before the
imperial throne at Peking once in twelve years. In practice
it appears that he does not do so with great regularity. The
expenses entailed by such a journey&mdash;chiefly in connection with
the valuable presents always expected by the Court on such
occasions&mdash;must be a very severe tax on his majesty's privy
purse.</p>

<p>The first appearance of a ruler of Chala in Chinese history
may be assigned to the first years of the Ming dynasty, in the
second half of the fourteenth century, when the king showed
his good-will to his mighty neighbour by assisting the imperial
troops in the frontier warfare of those days. In the fifth year
of Yung Lo (1407) he received the title of Ming Chêng Ssŭ,
and in the fifth year of K'ang Hsi (1666) his successor definitely
abjured his allegiance to Tibet and became a vassal of China.
In 1771 the king&mdash;whose name was Chia Mu Ts'an&mdash;received
official recognition from the emperor for his valuable assistance
against the Chin Ch'uan rebels, and received a Peacock's Feather
and the "button" of the Second Rank. Twenty years later
his successor had a similar honour conferred upon him for like
services, and in the fourteenth year of Chia Ch'ing (1809) the
king went with a retinue to Peking to do homage to the emperor.
Since then the history of the little state has gone through few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>
vicissitudes; but, now that the relations between China and
Tibet are going through a process of re-adjustment, it is probable
that the new administrative arrangements will tend to the
gradual effacement of the powers and privileges of all the Sino-Tibetan
kings and chiefs, including the ruler of Chala, and the
conversion of their territories into magistracies and prefectures
under the direct control of China. Perhaps this is a fitting
time, while "the old order changeth, yielding place to new,"
to put on record some account of systems of government and
constitutions that no doubt have in the past fulfilled some useful
purposes, but seem destined before long to pass utterly away.</p>

<p>It may not be generally known that according to the Chinese

attempt to identify the Ta Chin Sha Chiang&mdash;which must
obviously be a very great river&mdash;we are apt to be much puzzled;
for we read of it as flowing from western Tibet and also as flowing
through Burma into the "Southern Ocean." But the mystery
is explained when we remember that the great river of southern
Tibet&mdash;the Tsangpo or Yaru Tsangpo (literally "Upper River")&mdash;used
to be believed not only by Chinese but also by European
geographers to be the main feeder of the Irrawaddy. We now
know that the Tsangpo is no other than the main upper branch
of the Brahmaputra: or rather we assume it from much circumstantial
evidence. No European has yet followed the course of
the Brahmaputra up to the point where it receives the icy waters
of the Tibetan Tsangpo&mdash;which hurls itself over the edge of the
Tibetan plateau and creates there a series of waterfalls that must
be among the grandest sights in the world&mdash;but we now know,
from the reports of our native surveyors, the approximate position
of the falls.<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">414</a> The country between Assam and Tibet is unfortunately
inhabited by tribes that are apparently violently hostile to

celebration of marriages it is the genial custom of one of the
tribes to serve up the bridegroom's mother-in-law at the nuptial
banquet.</p>

<p>The Chinese geographers know the Tsangpo by its Tibetan
name (calling it the Ya-lu-tsang-pu-chiang, where <i lang="zh">chiang</i> is
tautological) but they also call it the Great (<i lang="zh">Ta</i>) Chin Sha
Chiang; and readers of their topographical works must beware

<h3><a id="NOTE_34"></a>NOTE 34 (<a href="#Page_219">p. 219</a>)</h3>

<p class="center">THE KING AND PEOPLE OF MULI</p>

<p>The ruler of Muli holds the rank, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Chinese
suzerain, of an <i lang="zh">An Fu Ssŭ</i> (see <a href="#NOTE_22">note 22</a>). In his own territory
he is a <i lang="bo">gyal-po</i> or king, but he is also a lama, and the succession
must therefore go to a collateral branch of the "royal" family.
In practice, the heir is generally a nephew who has been
inducted into Lamaism at an early age, and has risen high
in the hierarchy. The king of Muli first became tributary
to China in the seventh year of Yung Chêng (1729). He
received from the Chinese Government sealed "letters of
authority" and a stamped warrant similar to those bestowed
on the king of Chala. The greatest length of the territory,
from the frontier of the Litang principality on the north to
the territory of the Ku Po Chu <i lang="zh">t'u ssŭ</i> on the south, is 900
<i lang="zh">li</i> (say 300 miles); its greatest breadth is from the frontier
of Chala on the east to that of Chung-tien on the west,
1,300 <i lang="zh">li</i> (say 430 miles). These distances, as in the case of
Chala, are measured by length of actual paths, and not by
bee-lines. Though the Yalung forms the eastern boundary at
Pa-U-Rong, the Muli territory extends for a distance of some
scores of miles across the Yalung further south. According
to the <cite>Ssuch'uan T'ung Chih</cite> (published in the first half of
the nineteenth century) the total number of <i lang="zh">i jên</i> ("barbarians")
under the king's rule comprises 3,283 households. This figure
hardly enables us to assess the present population, which&mdash;if we
include the large body of lamas&mdash;can hardly be judged to
be less than 25,000. It should be remembered that there
are no towns in Muli, very little trade, and great areas of
mountainous country practically uninhabitable. The king's
annual tribute consists of 120 piculs of buckwheat (16,000
lbs.) estimated in cash value at 74 taels 4 mace and 3 horses,
each valued at 8 taels, or a total of 24 taels for the three.
The total tribute thus amounts (in money-value) to 98 taels
4 mace. These assessments of value were, of course, made
many years ago. Probably re-assessments are made from time
to time, as otherwise the monetary values would bear no
proper ratio to the value of the articles forming the basis of
the tribute. Payment is made at Yen-yüan-hsien, and is
supposed to be applied to the expenses of the local military
establishment. It is the custom of the country that one out
of every three, or two out of every five, male members of a
family enter the priesthood. All the lay population can be
called upon for military service; but it is hardly necessary
to say that the king keeps no standing army, and his people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span>
are only called to arms when serious disputes arise with the
neighbouring Tibetan chiefs. The <cite>T'ung Chih</cite> goes on to say
that the people of the land of Muli consist of six different
kinds of Barbarians: (1) <i lang="zh">lamas</i>; (2) <i lang="zh">Chia-mi</i> or <i lang="zh">Chieh-mi</i>
(<span lang="cmn-Hant">呷迷</span>); (3) <i lang="zh">Yüeh-ku</i> or <i lang="zh">Yo-ku</i> (<span lang="cmn-Hant">約古</span>); (4) <i lang="zh">Hsü-mi</i>
(<span lang="cmn-Hant">虛迷</span>); (5) <i lang="zh">Mo-so</i>; (6) <i lang="zh">Hsi Fan</i>. The lamas, of course, are
not a distinct race; the Mo-so and Hsi Fan are discussed in
Chapter XV. of this book; as for the three others, the remarks
made upon them in the <cite>T'ung Chih</cite> leave us very much in the
dark. The characteristics of the <i lang="zh">i jên</i> are dismissed in four
lines. We are told that the Chia-mi and Yüeh-ku are very
like one another, and that the women allow their hair to
hang over their shoulders. The Hsü-mi males cultivate a queue,
and the women do up their hair into a pointed coiffure. They
are docile, and of an amiable disposition. The Mo-so and Hsi
Fan are like each other, and honest and tractable by nature.
Their clothes are made of woven cloth, and their coats button
under the left arm (<i lang="zh">tso jên</i>; <i>cf.</i> the Confucian <cite>Lun Yü</cite>, p. 282,
Legge's edn.) The men wear queues and the women do up their
hair. They live by agriculture. They are fond of hunting wild
animals. This is all the <cite>T'ung Chih</cite> has to tell us about the
people of Muli. The section ends with the laconic remark
that lawsuits are decided by the <i lang="zh">k'an-po</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LANGUAGE-TEST OF RACE</div>

<p>Chinese customs certainly seem to be losing rather than
gaining ground in Muli: the queues worn by some of the men
do not hang down the back but are coiled round the head; and
it is not a mark of respect, as in China, to uncoil the queue.
Moreover the front of the head is not shaved, as in China.
The remarks about the women are true enough: a large proportion
wear their hair loose, so that they look like rather
overgrown and unwieldy school-girls; the rest have more or
less elaborate coiffures, but the female fashions of China in
this respect are totally ignored. I will leave the task of
identifying the Chia-mi, Yüeh-ku and Hsü-mi to some future
investigator with more time and leisure than fell to my lot.
Tibetans, Li-so, Man-tzŭ or Lolos, Kachins and Mo-so are all
doubtless to be found among the people of Muli, and it seems
not improbable that the predominant type is Mo-so.</p>

up. A page or two of skull measurements would help us more
towards settling the racial problems of western China than the
completest equipment of grammars and dictionaries. Unfortunately
the methods employed by many of the tribes for the disposal
of their dead will seriously hamper the investigations of
the craniologist who, in the hopes of a rich harvest of inexorable
bones, may take his measuring-tape to the graveyards of western

in the dead of winter by a few yak-herdsmen." The mines of
Tok-ya-long in western Tibet, he says, which have hitherto
been considered the highest habitation in the world are 525 feet
lower, and moreover are not inhabited all the year round.
There are other spots both in Muli and Chala, probably of a
greater height than 16,000 feet, that are inhabited, though the
huts are probably not occupied in winter.</p>

<h3><a id="NOTE_39"></a>NOTE 39 (<a href="#Page_259">p. 259</a>)</h3>

<p class="center">THE REBELLION IN YUNNAN</p>

<p>The best account of the Mohammedan rebellion is to be
found in M. Émile Rocher's <cite>La Province Chinoise du Yunnan</cite>,
vol. ii. pp. 30-192. The origin of the rebellion is to be traced to
a comparatively trifling dispute among miners, which took place
in 1855 in a mining centre situated between Yunnan-fu and
Tali-fu. The Mohammedan section of miners, who all worked
together, aroused envy and hatred because they had struck richer
veins of metal than the "orthodox" Chinese miners in a neighbouring
locality, and the result was a violent dispute which ended in
blows. The official who was responsible for good order in the
district was seized with panic and fled to Yunnan-fu, where
he submitted reports that were unjustifiably hostile to the
Mohammedans. The latter meanwhile had rendered themselves
masters of the situation, and drove their opponents off the field.
The people of the neighbouring town of Linan avenged this
insult by attacking the Mohammedans in overwhelming force
and expelling them to the forests. This was the beginning of
a series of bloodthirsty combats, which in a short time set the
whole province in a blaze, and caused the loss of millions of
human lives.</p>

<p>So far as race went, the Mohammedans of Yunnan were no
other than ordinary Yunnanese. They were marked off from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>
their fellow-provincials solely by their religion. This, however,
was sufficient to cause them to be treated almost as foreigners,
for they had little intercourse with orthodox Chinese, and
seem to have intermarried among themselves. Whether the
Mohammedans of Yunnan and other parts of China were&mdash;and
are&mdash;strict observers of the rules of their religion is a doubtful
point. Rocher says of the Yunnanese Mohammedans that
"they have preserved intact the beliefs of their ancestors, and
they rigorously observe the rules imposed upon them by the
Koran." Other observers, however,&mdash;including Mohammedan
natives of India&mdash;have scoffed at their co-religionists of Yunnan,
declaring that they know nothing of the tenets of Islam, and
obey none of the rules of their faith except that of abstinence
from pork. I have myself seen Chinese Mohammedan children
undergoing the pains of having page after page of Arabic
drilled into their little heads, though both they and their
teachers admitted that they did not understand the meaning of
a single word. The fact remains, however, that some Chinese
Mohammedans do still occasionally make the pilgrimage to
Mecca; and well-attended Mohammedan mosques may yet be
found in at least half the provinces of China.</p>

<p>Chinese Mohammedans have often proved a thorn in the
flesh of the official classes, not only in Yunnan, but also in
Kansu and elsewhere. Yet it cannot be said that they have
shown much of that fiery religious fanaticism which has sometimes
characterised Islam elsewhere. The great rebellion in
Yunnan did not originate in any religious dispute, and it would
never have developed into a war that lasted nearly twenty years
and laid waste a province, if only a few able and impartial
officials had given their attention to the matter in its early
stages.</p>

<p>Two circumstances helped to prolong the struggle. The first
was the great T'ai P'ing rebellion in eastern China, which
rendered the central Government powerless to deal effectually
with the situation in Yunnan; the second was the military skill
of the Mohammedan leaders, which led to the concentration of
the whole Mohammedan strength in the hands of a few able
men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OFFICIAL ACCOUNTS OF WESTERN TRIBES</div>

<p>The history of the war cannot be sketched here. It may be
sufficient to say that at one time nearly the whole province was
in the hands of the Mohammedan rebels; even Yunnan-fu itself
capitulated to their victorious arms. Before this took place,
the great Mohammedan leader, Tu Wên-hsiu, had already greatly
distinguished himself in the west of the province. Against the
will of the viceroy, who committed suicide, the officials had in
1856 planned and carried out a massacre of all Mohammedans
found within a radius of 800 <i lang="zh">li</i> from the capital. The news of
the massacre naturally roused in Tu Wên-hsiu intense feelings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span>
of indignation and hatred against the provincial Government
which had sanctioned an act of such hideous barbarity, and his
natural abilities and high reputation for courage and integrity
soon singled him out for leadership. His first great victory
secured him the city of Tali, which became the Mohammedan
headquarters. In 1867 he was proclaimed Imam or Sultan, and
Tali became the capital of a short-lived Mohammedan state.
It was held till 1873, when Tu Wên-hsiu, faced by hopeless
odds, surrendered it and poisoned himself. Before this time the
genius of General Gordon had put an end to the T'ai P'ing
rebellion, and the imperial Government was in a position to
oppose the Sultan with an overwhelming force. Only one result
was possible. With the capitulation of Tali and the death of
Tu Wên-hsiu the Mohammedans were able to make no further
headway against the imperial troops.</p>

<p>One of the most terrible results of this hideous civil war was
the recrudescence of the deadly disease now too well known to
us all as the plague. After the war the pestilence gradually
spread far beyond the limits of the province, and is still the
annual scourge of south China and India. It is probable, however,
that plague has for many centuries been endemic in the
valleys of western Yunnan. The accounts given of it by such
writers as Rocher and Baber, who witnessed its ravages in
Yunnan long before the fatal year when it was first observed
in Hong Kong (1894), are of great interest. The curious fact
that rats always seemed to be attacked before human beings was
noted by Rocher many years before the disease began to be
studied by medical experts. (See Rocher, <cite>op. cit.</cite>, vol. i. p. 75;
vol. ii. pp. 279-281.)</p>

<p class="center">CHINESE OFFICIAL ACCOUNTS OF WESTERN TRIBES</p>

<p>Several volumes of the official Provincial Annals of Yunnan
are devoted to a most elaborate quasi-ethnological enquiry into
the various tribal communities of that province. Unfortunately,
the conscientious industry of the compilers coupled with their
bland credulity and lack of critical training led them to fill
their pages with a great deal of matter that is useless and
misleading. The numbers and names of the tribes are quite
unnecessarily multiplied, and there is hardly any attempt at
classification or at the tracing of origins. Subdivisions of the
same race are treated as entirely separate, and any similarities
between them are either ignored or merely mentioned as unexplained
facts. Yet it must be admitted that as descriptions of
tribal customs and as store-houses of tradition and folk-lore the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span>
ethnological sections of the Annals are by no means to be
despised. The <cite>T'ung Chih</cite> of Ssuch'uan is less satisfactory in
this respect than that of Yunnan.</p>


<p><a id="NOTE_41"></a>NOTE 41 (<a href="#Page_284">p. 284</a>)</p>

<p class="center">THEORY OF INDIAN ORIGIN OF TRIBES</p>

<p>It seems quite clear that the Licchavis&mdash;or the great Vaggian
or Vrijian clan-system to which they belonged and from which
the Mauryans sprang&mdash;were neither Aryans nor Dravidians. In
all probability they were of Kolarian or Munda race. The
Kolarians seem to have entered India from the north-east&mdash;just
as the Aryans afterwards entered it from the north-west&mdash;and
extended themselves over vast areas from which they were subsequently
driven by Dravidians and Aryans. They must have
originally come from the countries that lay to the east, which we
now know as Burma, China and Indo-China. They probably
left many of their Kolarian kinsfolk behind them, and it may
have been through keeping up communications with the latter
that they were able to introduce into their old homes something
of the new culture and civilisation that they acquired in their
new homes in India. The Kolarian dialects are known to be
akin to those of certain tribes in Burma, and so far as personal
characteristics are concerned a description of the Kolarian tribes
as they are known to-day in parts of Bengal would be applicable,
word for word, to some of the peoples of Indo-China and
Yunnan. "The Kolarian people," says Mr J. F. Hewitt, who
lived among them, "may generally be described as gregarious,
excitable, turbulent when roused, but generally peaceable and
good-humoured. They are brave and adventurous, witty, and
very fond of amusement, not given to work more than is necessary,
and as a rule very careless of the future." (<cite>J.R.A.S.</cite>, vol. xx.
p. 330.) It must be remembered, however, that the Burmese
people, to whom these words are also applicable, are now believed
by the best authorities to have come from "the Mongolian
countries north of Magadha." (Sir George Scott's <cite>Burma</cite>, p. 66.)</p>

<p>Many of the tribes of western China&mdash;some of the Lolos and
Min-chia, for instance&mdash;are often described as possessing a type
of features that is almost European; and Mr Kingsmill seems to
derive from this fact some support of his theory of their Indian
(Aryan) origin. "The distinctive colouring," he says, "closely
approximates to the Aryan type of the Indian peninsula," etc.
(<cite>J.R.A.S.</cite> (China Branch), vol. xxxv. p. 95.) But the Mauryans
themselves, as we have seen, were not of Aryan origin. The
Licchavis are referred to in Manu as one of the "base-born"<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span>
castes for that very reason&mdash;in spite of the fact that they
possessed great power and prestige and very wide influence.
It seems very doubtful whether an Aryan emigration from India
to China took place at any time. India always offered full scope
for all Aryan energies; indeed we know that the Aryans by no
means became so universally predominant, even in India, as one
might gather from the early and wide extension of their language
and religion. If there really is an Aryan element among the
tribes of western China it would be curious to speculate on the
possibility of its having come by a non-Indian route.</p>

<p>Chandragupta's reign probably began in 320 B.C., and his

not yet absolutely fixed, but I rely with some confidence on the

<p class="center">VESÂLI AND THE LICCHAVIS</p>

<p>For further information regarding Vesâli and the Licchavis
see W. W. Rockhill's <cite>Life of the Buddha</cite>, pp. 62 <cite>seq.</cite>, and 203
(<cite>footnote</cite>), Dr Rhys Davids' <cite>Buddhist India</cite>, pp. 40-41, and two
articles by Mr Vincent Smith in the Royal Asiatic Society's
<cite>Journal</cite> for April 1902 and January 1905. One of Mr Rockhill's
Tibetan authorities connects the Licchavis with the Sakyas or
Çakyas to whom the Buddha himself belonged. "The Çakyas,"
says this authority, were "divided into three parts, whose most
celebrated representatives were Çakya the Great (the Buddha),
Çakya the Licchavi, and Çakya the Mountaineer. Grya Khri
btsan po, the first Tibetan King, belonged to the family of Çakya
the Licchavi. Many other Buddhist sovereigns of India and
elsewhere claimed the same descent." This note is of interest
as showing the wide extent and long duration of Licchavi
influence, and the desire of powerful races and kings to trace a
connection with the family of the Buddha. "Çakya, the
Licchavi" may, of course, have become a member of the clan
by adoption. Caste-rules (even supposing they precluded
adoption) did not hold good among the Licchavis, who were not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span>
Aryans. With respect to the possible connection of the Buddha's
family with the Licchavis, all that can be said for certain is
that the Licchavis were among the earliest and most devoted
supporters of the Buddhist faith, and that Vesâli soon became a
city of great religious importance. Buddhism, indeed, was less
of an Aryan religion than people have been in the habit of
supposing. The Sakyas themselves were almost certainly an
Aryan people; we know that their exclusiveness and intense
pride of birth brought about the destruction of their capital at
the hands of Vidūdabha. But it seems quite clear that Buddhism
progressed most rapidly and won its greatest victories among
people of non-Aryan race, and this not only in foreign lands
but in India itself. Buddhism did not achieve its wonderful
successes in India in the third century <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> and afterwards by
means of the conversion of Brahmans. It is far truer to say
that Buddhism spread on account of its adoption by northern
non-Aryan tribes which, in spite of Aryan conquests, remained
very powerful both in numbers and in political influence. (See
on this point B. H. Baden-Powell's <cite>Notes on the Origin of the
"Lunar" and "Solar" Aryan Tribes</cite>, <cite>J.R.A.S.</cite>, April 1899,

Mr I. H. Marshall and Dr Sten Konow. (See <cite>J.R.A.S.</cite>, October

expected to carry out good work at Pagan or elsewhere without

more difficult and more costly. It is not pleasing to observe
that the Archæological Departments of India, Burma and Ceylon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span>

recent Franco-Siamese treaty it was announced in the French
press that steps were being taken forthwith to carry out some
expensive archæological and preservative work at the magnificent
ruins of Angkor Wat, which are within the Cambodian territory
acquired by France under the treaty. Is England always to

<p class="center">THE BURMESE LABOUR QUESTION</p>

<p>One aspect of the labour question in Burma does not seem
to have attracted the attention it deserves. In spite of Mr
Fielding Hall's optimism, the belief that the apathetic Burman is
being shouldered out of his own country by more hard-working
immigrants, especially natives of India, is a very prevalent one,
not only among European observers, but even among some classes
of the Burmese themselves. At present no Burman dares to
raise a protest against the influx of labourers, who, if they do
not utterly crush him in the course of the struggle for existence,
may at least degrade him from the high level of comfort and
social well-being in which he now lives. The day may come
when the Burman will demand that this alien immigration be
interdicted. If he does so, what will be the attitude of the
Government? Probably anything but sympathetic. The White
races of Australia, British Columbia and California object to the
influx of Chinese and Japanese labourers for reasons practically
identical with those that would actuate the Burman, and if their
attitude is a justifiable one can it be argued that the Burmese
attitude would not be equally so? The Burman would doubtless
be told by the European, whose material interests in Burma
depend on the unrestricted immigration of hard-working aliens,
that his country cannot be allowed to go to waste; that if he,
through his laziness, will not develop it to the utmost, some one
else must be found who will develop it in his stead. But the
Chinese and Japanese might if they were strong enough&mdash;and
perhaps some day they will be strong enough&mdash;knock at the
gates of Australia, Canada and the United States, and demand
admission on precisely similar grounds. No one will deny that
the scarcity and high price of labour in those countries have
seriously retarded, and are still retarding, nearly every form of
industrial and agricultural development; yet the Yellow races
are excluded on the grounds that they would lower the White
man's standard of living, and that they are in the habit of sending
their earnings out of the country. I do not say the White
man's attitude is unreasonable: but I do not see how, on our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span>
own principles, we could refuse to restrict the immigration of
black aliens into Burma if the Burmese people&mdash;on grounds
identical with those that actuate our own conduct in Canada
and elsewhere&mdash;demanded that we should do so. Such action
would no doubt be an artificial restriction of natural economic
tendencies, and so might bring its own punishment in the long-run;
but the same remark applies to the policy adopted in our
own colonies.</p>

<p>We have recently become so much accustomed to hear of the
antagonism and rivalry of interests between East and West&mdash;as
if all Eastern countries represented one set of immutable
ideals and all Western countries another&mdash;that we are apt to
lose ourselves in a mist of generalities. The East has problems
of its own to solve, some of which reproduce in a more restricted
area the racial problems that are beginning at a late hour to
agitate the minds of statesmen in Europe and America. The
European speaks with half-hearted contempt (behind which
lurks a secret dread) of a Yellow Peril: the Burman is disquieted
by a no less threatening Black Peril that is already
within his gates, and his gates still stand open with a dangerous
hospitality.</p>

<p class="center">MILITARY QUALITIES OF ORIENTALS</p>

<p>The British officers who trained and led the recently-disbanded
Chinese Regiment are known to have formed a high
opinion of the personal courage of the Chinese as represented by
the men of that regiment. When it is remembered that the
very existence of the regiment as a unit in the British Army was
an anomaly, and that at Tientsin and Peking the men fought
as mercenaries against their own countrymen, the fact that they
behaved well under fire is all the more noteworthy. It may be
taken for granted that even the Japanese soldier, if ordered to
charge an unruly mob of his own countrymen, would hardly
show the brilliant daring that he displayed before Port Arthur.</p>

<p>When Europe was startled by the news of some of the great
Japanese victories in Manchuria, an English newspaper made
the somewhat hasty suggestion that the Japanese were "scientific
fanatics," and the phrase was caught up and repeated with
approbation by many. Why fanatics? Simply because the
Japanese troops had behaved with such unheard-of heroism that
Europe was unable to reconcile such conduct with its own ideas
of what constituted bravery. What many Englishmen said, in
effect, was this: "The conduct ordinarily shown by British
troops in action is bravery; to go beyond this is fanaticism.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span>
The criterion of true courage is the average conduct of the average
British soldier on the field of battle." The Japanese who with
reckless gallantry gave their lives for emperor and country on
the battle-fields of Liao-tung, and who considered it a disgrace
to return home without a wound, were fanatics. Well, if so, it
is a kind of fanaticism that every European Government would
like to see spread among its own fighting-men when the day of
battle comes.</p>


<h3><a id="NOTE_48"></a>NOTE 48 (<a href="#Page_388">p. 388</a>)</h3>

<p class="center">"THE YELLOW PERIL"</p>

<p>With some people the antipathy to the Oriental amounts to
a positive horror, inexplicable even by themselves in ordinary
language, and very often based on no personal experience. "I
know not," said De Quincey, "what others share in my feelings on
this point; but I have often thought that if I were compelled to
forego England, and to live in China, among Chinese manners
and modes of life and scenery, I should go mad. The causes of
my horror lie deep, and some of them must be common to
others.... In China, over and above what it has in common
with the rest of southern Asia, I am terrified by the modes of
life, by the manners, by the barrier of utter abhorrence placed
between myself and them, by counter-sympathies deeper than
I can analyse. I could sooner live with lunatics, with vermin, with
crocodiles or snakes." When we have made all allowances for
the excited utterances of an opium-dreamer, these words indicate
the existence of intensely strong feelings of racial antipathy, and
there is no reason to regard De Quincey as the only European
who has entertained such feelings. Does our subliminal consciousness
retain dim ancestral memories of mighty struggles
waged æons ago for the survival and supremacy of our own racial
type? And does it harbour a vague prophetic dread of a more
terrific warfare yet to come?</p>

<p>What is perhaps at the root of this horror of Asiatics felt
by some Europeans is an instinctive feeling that the world is
not large enough to contain or afford free play for the energies
of both races; coupled perhaps with an ugly doubt whether, in
spite of all the great material achievements of the West in
recent years, the European type is after all the fittest to survive
in the struggle for existence. Huxley long ago reminded us
that the "survival of the fittest" does not necessarily imply
the survival of the "best" or most highly developed. He points
out, for instance, that if certain conceivable changes were to
come about in atmospheric conditions, the law of the survival
of the fittest might bring about the extinction of all living<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span>
things except "lichens, diatoms, and such microscopic organisms
as those which give red snow its colour."<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">416</a> They would be the
sole survivors of the struggle for existence because they alone
were adapted to the new environment. It may be that at some
future period in the course of the struggle&mdash;though long before
we have reached the lichen and diatom stage&mdash;certain conditions
may prove hostile to the continued existence of the White races
and favourable to that of the Yellow. Lafcadio Hearn, who in
spite of his "de-occidentalisation" admitted the superiority of
the Western races&mdash;without explaining what he meant by
"superiority"&mdash;expressed the belief that in the "simple power
of living" they are immensely inferior to those of the East.
"The Occidental," he says, "cannot live except at a cost sufficient
for the maintenance of twenty Oriental lives. In our very
superiority lies the secret of our fatal weakness. Our physical
machinery requires a fuel too costly to pay for the running of it
in a perfectly conceivable future period of race-competition and
pressure of population." He conjectures that some day the
Western peoples may be crushed out of existence, their successors
scarcely regretting their disappearance "anymore than we ourselves
regret the extinction of the dinotherium or the ichthyosaurus."
Why indeed should they? When we consider how seldom the
memory even of our own dead ancestors touches our sympathies
or prompts an affectionate thought it will not seem strange that
in the days to come the victorious Yellow man may regard the
extinct White man with no more emotion than the visitor to a
museum now regards the wire-linked bones of a prehistoric
monster. No creature that is doomed to failure in the struggle
for existence need look to the conquerors for the least sign of
pity or sympathy. The poor dodo has vanished from the scene
of its joys and sorrows for ever, but that is not the reason why
the nightingale's song is sometimes a sad one. No less cheerfully
warbles the thrush because the great auk will flap his
ineffectual wings no more. Even the crocodile refrains from
shedding tears over the fossil remains of the Triassic <i>stagonolepis</i>.</p>

<p>It behoves us to remember that victory in the struggle for
existence is not a victory once and for all. The doom of the
conqueror in this fight is that he must never sheathe his sword.
The prize goes always to him who deserves it, but no rest is
allowed him when the battle is over. New challengers are ever
pressing into the lists, and the challenged must go ever armed
and with lance in rest.</p>

<p>The grim tragedy once enacted periodically at Aricia might
be interpreted, not too fancifully, as a miniature representation
of the more terrible struggle that is for ever in progress through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span>out
the whole world of animate nature. The guardian of the
Golden Bough&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The priest who slew the slayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shall himself be slain"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>retained his position and his life only so long as they were not
challenged by one more vigorous or more dexterous than himself.</p>

<p>The great nations of the West have won their material
pre-eminence by overcoming weaker competitors, who in their
turn had once been conquerors. They will keep their prizes
so long as they deserve to keep them, and no longer. Exclusion
laws and trades-unions and cunning appliances wrought by
scientific and intellectual skill may stave off the day of disaster,
but if the White races have no better support than such things
as these, for them the day of doom will assuredly dawn.</p>

<p>Yet a struggle for predominance among great sections of
the human race need not imply actual physical warfare. If the
Yellow races are to be supreme, it will be partly because
the White races have suicidally contributed to their own ruin.
If White men become too intensely careful of the individual life,
and too careless of the welfare of the race; if they allow luxury
to sap their energies and weaken their moral fibre; if they insist
too strongly on "rights" and show too slack a devotion to
"duty"; if they regard the accumulation of wealth as the be-all
and end-all of existence; if selfishness impels their young men
to avoid matrimony, and their young women to shun the duties
of maternity; if they give way to these and other social vices to
which our age bears witness, they cannot reasonably expect
to compete advantageously with people who have no craving
for luxury, and scarcely know what it means; who look not to
wealth as a means for individual aggrandisement; who are at
all times willing to sink personal interests in the larger interests
of family and clan; who are tireless and uncomplaining workers;
among whom parenthood is a religious necessity, and artificial
restrictions of the birth-rate are practically unknown; and whose
women are free from political aspirations and willing to do their
duty at the domestic fireside and in the nursery.</p>

<p>The Yellow Peril, then, is no mere myth: let so much be
granted. Yet the recognition of its existence need not drive
us to utter pessimism, so long as our faults are not irremediable,
and our virtues not reduced to inactivity. The shaping of our
fate lies, to some extent at least, in our own hands, and, after
all, the outlook for the West is not entirely gloomy. The mere
proximity of a peril does not make the brave man falter and
tremble; on the contrary, it braces his nerves, and increases
his alertness. If the East has qualities and virtues that make
for great strength, it is no less clearly lacking in other qualities
and virtues that still find a home in the West. The Yellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span>
Peril, so far from driving us to a cowardly despair, may and
should have the effect of raising our courage, ennobling our ideals,
up rooting our selfishness and purifying Western society. It may
enable us to see that in some respects our aims have been false
ones, and that our views of the essentials of progress and of
civilisation must be partially modified. The recognition of the
existence of our own diseases may lead to the discovery of
the means of cure. The East has begun in recent years to learn
some valuable lessons from the West; is it not time that we
returned the compliment? If we could but bring ourselves to
do so, perhaps at no very distant period the Yellow Peril
might turn out to be the White Salvation.</p>

<p><i>The Spectator</i> says:&mdash;"It is with no small satisfaction that we note the republication,
under the title of 'A Nation in Arms,' of the speeches on the question of
National Service delivered by Lord Roberts.... It is not the creation of a military
caste for which he pleads, but the building up of the highest type of citizen&mdash;the
citizen who is able to protect his native land and his rights and liberties himself and
without external aid, and who believes that national safety is not to be hired, but to
be achieved by self-sacrifice.... It is hardly necessary to say that Lord Roberts
and those who agree with him ask for national training such as is willingly and
cheerfully undergone by the citizens of Switzerland, not for that which is imposed on
the German population. We have one more word to say&mdash;that is, to ask our readers
to study carefully Lord Roberts' book. We would specially ask this of those who
dread, and, as we hold, are right in dreading, militarism, and who look forward to
universal peace as the ultimate goal for mankind. They will find that Lord Roberts
has not a word to say in praise of war.... What he does desire is that as long as
war continues&mdash;and no sane man can, unfortunately, doubt its continuance in our
generation&mdash;the British people shall, when it comes, be prepared to meet it."</p>

America. <b>By E. F. Knight.</b> Author of "Where Three
Empires Meet," "Small Boat Sailing," etc. With 9 Coloured
Maps. Crown 8vo. <b>6s.</b></p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. E. F. Knight, the well-known traveller and war correspondent, in this
volume gives a description of what he calls the Nearer Empire&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the British
possessions in the Mediterranean, Africa, and America. The book is no mere
collection of geographical facts. It seeks to show what the Empire is, how it came
to be, and what is the history of its growth. It deals also with the political development
and the economic resources of the Colonies. The descriptive parts have an
additional charm through being to a large extent a record of personal observation.
To quote from the Preface:&mdash;"The author has travelled in most of the countries
over which the British flag flies. He has witnessed, and on some occasions taken
part in the making of several portions of that Empire in times both of peace and war,
and has therefore been able to draw on his own personal experiences and observations
when writing this short account of Britain beyond the seas."</p>

thoroughly understands horses, so that he is enabled to offer very valuable service

66-68 of the Third Georgic are equally striking in this respect:

It was just such reflections as this that filled the heart of the
Sakya prince with pity and love for mankind. <i>Sunt lacrimae rerum
et mentem mortalium tangunt</i>, the beautiful utterance of "the chastest
and royalest" of poets, expresses the feeling that prompted the Great
Renunciation and gave to the world a Buddha.</p></div>

 Avalokiteçvara is the Chinese Kuan Yin, generally represented in
China (where temples to this divinity are exceedingly numerous) as a
female, and known to Europeans as the "Goddess of Mercy." The
change of sex is due to an identification of this Bodhisattva with a
legendary Chinese princess, who devoted herself to saving human lives,
especially from the dangers of the sea. She has thus become in a
special sense the guardian deity of sailors; but she is also worshipped
by women as the goddess who grants male offspring. Mahâsthâma is
the Chinese Ta Shih Chih, the Bodhisattva of Great Strength. Eitel,
in his <cite>Handbook of Chinese Buddhism</cite>, says that this Bodhisattva is
perhaps the same as Maudgalyâyana; but this is a mistake, as is quite
clear from the fact that, in certain sutras, such as the Amitâyur-Dhyāna
Sutra, they figure as separate personalities.</p></div>

 Any one who is not hopelessly narrow-minded can thoroughly
sympathise with the missionary position. The missionaries as a
body are men of religious enthusiasm. They believe they have
been summoned by their Master to preach to non-Christians a faith
which they believe to be the only true faith; and some of them believe
that an acceptance of this faith is "necessary to salvation." From
their point of view, all missionary work is entirely justified; and
from any point of view the work the Christian missions have done
in alleviating sickness and pain in China is wholly admirable. As
regards the purely religious aspect of the question, I am glad to
refrain from expressing a personal opinion. It is a subject which
requires to be handled with extraordinary delicacy, for many people
are unable to discuss it dispassionately, and it gives rise to endless
arguments which from the nature of the case are and must be utterly
devoid of persuasive power. Now that Religion, as distinct from
any systematised Creed, has taken its place among the recognised
subjects of philosophical investigation (and psychological also, as in
Professor James's brilliant book, <cite>The Varieties of Religious Experience</cite>),
we may expect to hear missionary work discussed (at least by educated
persons) with less bitterness and strong language than has sometimes
disgraced the controversialists on both sides. A short and incomplete
but very interesting discussion of the missionary question from an
obviously impartial point of view may be found in Professor Knight's
<cite>Varia</cite>, pp. 31-35. (John Murray: 1901.)</p></div>

 Manjusri (<span lang="cmn-Hant">文殊師利</span>) is a Bodhisattva who in China
is practically worshipped as the God of Wisdom. Like Ti Tsang,
Kuan Yin and others, he is supposed to have had a human prototype,
or rather to have been incarnated in the body of a historical personage.
But the truth probably is that any person of superlative wisdom
was liable to be identified by his admirers with Manjusri. There is
an interesting reference to him in I-Tsing's <cite>Records of the Buddhist
Religion</cite>, translated by J. Takakusu (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1896),
p. 169. The translator comments on the fact that Manjusri was even
by the people of India supposed, at one time, to be somehow connected
with China, and the actual place of his residence was identified as
Ping Chou in Chih-li.</p></div>

 A somewhat similar phenomenon, described as an "anthelia,"
may be witnessed in Ceylon. Sir James Emerson Tennent, in his
<cite>Ceylon</cite> [Longmans: 1859, 2nd edition], states that phenomena of this
kind may have "suggested to the early painters the idea of the glory
surrounding the heads of beatified saints." He adds this description:
"To the spectator his own figure, but more particularly the head,
appears surrounded by a halo as vivid as if radiated from diamonds.
The Buddhists may possibly have taken from this beautiful object their
idea of the <i>agni</i> or emblem of the sun, with which the head of Buddha
is surmounted. But, unable to express a <i>halo</i> in sculpture, they
concentrated it into a <i>flame</i>."&mdash;Vol. i. 72 <i>seq.</i></p></div>

 The complications and variations in currency and money values
constitute one of the greatest vexations to a European traveller in
China. As is well known, the ordinary medium of exchange in China
for small purchases is the "cash" (<i lang="zh">t'ung ch'ien</i>) of which about 1,000
(sometimes more and sometimes less) are equivalent to a dollar
(Mex). In larger transactions silver sycee or "broken" silver is used,
in which case payments are made by weight and according to the
"touch" or fineness of the silver. The ingots are cut up by the use
of sycee-shears into small or large portions as required. The larger
ingots&mdash;which in Ssuch'uan are generally of the approximate value
of ten taels each (equivalent to nearly two pounds)&mdash;usually bear the
guarantee "chops" of bankers and large merchants. In the west
of Ssuch'uan the Indian rupee became many years ago a well-known
and much appreciated coin, and very largely took the place of broken
silver. Its convenient size and shape specially commended it to the
Chinese and Tibetan merchants who had trade relations with Burma,
Tibet and India: and as its exchange-value in and about Tachienlu
was in excess of its face-value many Yunnanese merchants used to
bring mule-loads of rupees to that city from Tali-fu, thereby making
a very considerable profit. The coin was generally known as the
<i lang="zh">lama-t'ou</i> or Lama's Head&mdash;Queen Victoria's head being supposed to be
that of a lama&mdash;and also as <i lang="zh">yang ch'ien</i> or "foreign money," the same
term that is often applied in other parts of China to the Mexican and
British dollars. Recently the provincial Government prohibited the
circulation of Indian rupees in Ssuch'uan, and began to issue a
similar coin of its own at the Mint in Ch'êng-tu. The new coin is
almost exactly equivalent in value to the Indian rupee, and resembles
it in size and appearance: but it bears the head of the emperor
of China instead of that of the emperor of India. It is interesting
as being the first Chinese coin, so far as I am aware, to bear the
sovereign's head. Probably had it borne no head at all it would have
been regarded with suspicion and dislike by those who had for years
been accustomed to the Indian rupee. One of the Ssuch'uanese coins
(a half-rupee) is illustrated in the text, along with the obverse and
reverse of a Tibetan coin also in common use about Tachienlu and
western Ssuch'uan. I found the new Ssuch'uan rupee was accepted
fairly willingly by the people between Tachienlu and Pa-U-Rong, less
willingly by those of the Muli country. South of Yung-ning I again
had recourse to broken silver; but west of Tali-fu the Indian rupee is
generally accepted, and at the town of Hsia Kuan, near Tali-fu, Indian
rupees can be bought in any quantity by travellers and merchants
bound for Burma. The Indian rupee is now a rare coin in Ssuch'uan,
but sometimes it is treated like broken silver, being cut into pieces
and sold by weight. I have in my possession several mutilated rupees
which were weighed out to me as small change. The late queen-empress's
head has been treated with small respect by the silver-merchants.</p></div>

 It has been pointed out by Griesbach that the central Himālayan

Apparently the same is the case in the "Himālayas" of Tibetan

 Customs of this kind seem to exist or to have existed all over
the world. For Tibet, see Sarat Chandra Das's <cite>Journey to Lhasa and
Central Tibet</cite>, and several recent works. Frazer, in the <cite>Golden Bough</cite>
(2nd edn. vol. iii. pp. 4-6), has an interesting note in which he mentions
the same or similar customs in the Solomon and Banks Islands,
Nicaragua, Guatemala, Central and South Africa, Bolivia, Burma and
Korea. He says: "The act is not a religious rite, for the thing thrown
on the heap is not an offering to spiritual powers, and the words
which accompany the act are not a prayer. It is nothing but a
magical ceremony for getting rid of fatigue, which the simple savage
fancies he can embody in a stick, leaf, or stone, and so cast it
from him." Gipsies have a custom of leaving heaps of stones and
bits of stick at cross-roads, to guide members of their band who have
fallen behind. I do not propose to argue from this fact that the
gipsy race was originally a Tibetan tribe, in spite of the facts that
both gipsies and Tibetans love a wandering life, and that the gipsies
of Persia and the Tibetans use almost the same word for "tent," which
is <i>guri</i> in Persia and <i>gur</i> (<span lang="bo">གུར་</span>) in Tibet.</p></div>

of its deadliness. Rocher, in his excellent history of Yunnan, remarks
that the only people who could live on the banks of the Red River
with comparative immunity were some indigenous non-Chinese tribes
and Cantonese merchants. As regards the Cantonese, the jealous
Yunnanese supposed that their immunity was derived from the fact
that they possessed a sovereign remedy for the disease, but kept the
secret of it to themselves so that they alone should obtain the benefit.
Some of the Yunnanese told Rocher that they would go into battle
rather than brave a visit to the banks of the Red River.&mdash;(<cite>La Province
Chinoise du Yunnan</cite>, vol. i. pp. 229, 230, and 286.)</p></div>

A fuller account of polyandry in Ceylon may be found in Tennent's
<cite>Ceylon</cite> (Longmans, 1859, 2nd ed. vol. ii. pp. 428 <cite>seq.</cite>). Tennent points out
that polyandry can be traced back to very ancient times. It "receives
a partial sanction in the Institutes of Manu," and is referred to without
reproach in the Mahabharata. Herbert Spencer (<cite>Principles of Ethics</cite>,
pt. ii. ch. 13) says that in Tibet, "polyandry appears more conducive
to social welfare than any other relation of the sexes. It receives
approval from travellers, and even a Moravian missionary defends
it: the missionary holding that superabundant population, in an
unfertile country, must be a great calamity and produce 'eternal
welfare or eternal want.'" See also <cite>Principles of Sociology</cite>. Polyandry
is forbidden in the Shan States, though polygamy is sanctioned. (See
<cite>Gazetteer of Upper Burma</cite>, pt. i. vol. i. p. 325.)</p></div>

But see M. Paul Vial (<cite>Les Lolos</cite>: Shanghai, 1898). If M. Vial's
theory of the origin of the word Lolo is correct, it was originally
by no means a disrespectful term. He considers that it is a Chinese
reduplication of a form of the word <i>No</i> or <i>Na</i>, which was the special
name of one of the patrician tribes of the Lolos. He admits, however,
that the term is now regarded as impolite. He says that the
Lolos have now no common name for the whole race, but simply
employ the various tribal names as occasion requires. The Chinese
characters for Lolo (generally <span lang="cmn-Hant">玀玀</span>) are merely phonetic. The
constant use of the "dog" radical in the Chinese characters employed
to represent the names of barbarous tribes is an instructive indication
of the contemptuous Chinese attitude towards such people. In the
word <i>Man</i> the radical is an insect or reptile.</p></div>

fact that the Chinese and the T'ai belong to a family of which the
Chinese are the most prominent representatives."</p></div>

 In Tibetan <i lang="bo">Sa</i> is "earth" or "land," and <i lang="bo">t'am</i> is "seal" (<i>sigillum</i>)

a Mo-so word.</p></div>

 We have seen on pages 249-250 that the plain west of that of
Li-chiang is called Lashi-Pa, or Plain of the Mo-so, and that a village
therein bears the same name. M. Paul Vial mentions what he calls a
<i>Lolo</i> tribe named Ashi, apparently dwelling in the south-east of Yunnan
(<cite>Les Lolos</cite>, p. 25). Now only a few miles west of Lashi-Pa, on the road
from Li-chiang to Chung-tien, there is a village called Ashi, which
gives its name to a ferry on the Yangtse river. It is possible that the
sound in both cases was once either Lashi or Nashi, for, when we find
from experience that the <i>L</i> and <i>N</i> are interchangeable, it may well be
that in some districts inhabited by Mo-so the initial has been dropped
altogether. I do not know the derivation of the word Lashio, the
British settlement near the Salwen valley, in the North Shan States.
There is also a district called Lashi, in British territory, north-east of
Myitkyina, the people of which appear to be a connecting link between
the Kachins and the Burmese. (See Sir George Scott's <cite>Burma</cite>, p. 70.)</p></div>

 It is to the "Mauryan" Man-tzŭ that Mr Kingsmill ascribes the
excavation of the caves of Ssuch'uan (see <a href="#Page_46">pp. 46</a> <i>seq.</i>). He says that
they were evidently the work of a people who had made considerable
progress in the arts, and that the art in its predominant features
approaches more nearly to ancient Indian types than to Chinese
(<cite>Journal</cite> of the Royal Asiatic Society, China Branch, vol. xxxv. p. 93).
As I have already stated, there is not much evidence of a strong
artistic instinct in the decoration of the caves. I agree with Mr
Kingsmill, nevertheless, in ascribing the art, such as it is, to Indian
influences.</p></div>

 In this connection Mr Kingsmill explains that the character <i lang="zh">hsiang</i>
(<span lang="cmn-Hant">象</span>), which means "elephant," was also originally pronounced Ser.
I have already mentioned a mountain-pass called the Ta Hsiang Ling
which is supposed to be named after either P'u Hsien's elephant or
Chu-ko Liang. (See <a href="#Page_117">p. 117</a> and <a href="#NOTE_14">Note 14</a>.) To the south of that pass
there is another named the Hsiao Hsiang Ling, or Small Elephant
Pass, which must be crossed on the way to the Chien-ch'ang valley.
Mr Kingsmill would perhaps translate the names of these passes as the
Great and Small Passes of the Ts'in or Ser; in which case we may
regard Ts'in Shih Huang-ti as being a third claimant to the honour of
giving a name to this pass.</p></div>

 Hung Wu was the "reign-title" of the first emperor of the Ming
dynasty, who reigned from 1368 to 1398. His successor, whose "reign-title"
was Chien Wên, ruled from 1399 to 1402. With regard to the
Yangtse being taken as the southern limit of China, this statement
can only be accepted with an important modification, for all the
southern provinces of China, including Yunnan, were at this time
regarded as being within the empire, though the fact that they
were chiefly inhabited by non-Chinese tribes made it somewhat
anomalous to describe them as forming part of China proper. We
have seen that Yunnan was annexed to the empire by Kúblái Khan
in the thirteenth century. Towards the close of the following century
the Yunnanese princes tried to reassert their independence, and the
province was again reduced to complete submission by the generals
of the emperor Hung Wu himself, who, in spite of his maps, never
for a moment intended to relax the imperial hold on that distant
province.</p></div>

 See, for instance, Mr R. B. Arnold's <cite>Scientific Fact and Metaphysical
Reality</cite>, pp. 321-323. Professor William James, in his <cite>Varieties of
Religious Experience</cite>, asks whether "the worship of material luxury
and wealth, which constitutes so large a portion of the 'spirit' of
our age" does not "make somewhat for effeminacy and unmanliness."
He goes so far as to recommend, as a cure for some of our social diseases,
the adoption of that form of asceticism which consisted in "the old
monkish poverty-worship." Wealth-getting, he says, "enters as an
ideal into the very bone and marrow of our generation." It is certain,
he adds, that "the prevalent fear of poverty among the educated classes
is the worst moral disease from which our civilisation suffers."&mdash;(Pp.
365-369.)
</p>
<p>
See also Professor W. R. Inge's <cite>Personal Idealism and Mysticism</cite>,
especially pp. 175-176. I strongly recommend the reader who is
interested in the pressing problems presented by the changing relations
between the Occident and the Orient to read Dr Inge's book (especially
Lectures IV. and VI.) in connection with Mr Percival Lowell's <cite>Soul of
the Far East</cite>. Both are, as one would expect, able and well-written
books, but they take diametrically opposite views of a very important
question. Mr Lowell finds that the most notable characteristic of
the East, and the secret of its fatal weakness, is what he calls its
Impersonality, and that the peoples of the West, deriving an irresistible
strength from the exact opposite&mdash;an intense Individualism&mdash;have
nothing to fear from the impersonal civilisations of the East, which
they will eventually overpower and crush. Dr Inge arrives independently
at a similar belief as to the remarkable absence of individualism
in the East, but so far from adopting Mr Lowell's interpretation of its
results he finds in this Oriental Impersonality a very remarkable source
of strength and permanence; while he prognosticates possible disaster
to Western civilisation from the very fact that it is based on
individualism. Already, he says, "it shows signs of breaking up from
within." It seems possible that the events of the not-distant future
will show that Dr Inge was right.</p></div>

 "It is the way in which hours of freedom are spent that determines,
as much as war or as labour, the moral worth of a nation. It raises or
lowers, it replenishes or exhausts. At present we find, in these great
cities of ours, that three days' idleness will fill the hospitals with victims
whom weeks or months of toil had left unscathed."&mdash;Maurice Maeterlinck,

 A cutting from the sacred tree (a species subsequently known as
the <i>ficus religiosa</i>) under which Gautama is believed to have sat when he
attained Buddhahood, was brought from India to Ceylon about the year
245 <small>B.C.</small> and planted at Anuradhapura, then the Singhalese capital. It
is still growing there, and is annually visited by countless pilgrims from
all parts of the Buddhist world.</p></div>

 Herbert Spencer, in the <cite>Principles of Ethics</cite>, speaks of "the many
who, in the East, tacitly assume that Indians exist for the benefit
of Anglo-Indians." He is right in saying it is tacitly assumed; for
few go so far as to say openly that the Indians are destined by Nature
to be exploited by the White races. But the tacit assumption often
leavens their thoughts and discourses on "the native question." One
recent writer, indeed, distinctly states that "it is an inexorable law
of progress that inferior races are made for the purpose of serving
the superior; and if they refuse to serve, they are fatally condemned
to disappear." (W. H. Brown, <cite>On the South African Frontier</cite>). But
who is to decide which are "the inferior races"?</p></div>

 I earnestly commend to the reader's notice an admirable leader
in the <cite>Times</cite> of 15th January 1907, which closes with these words:
"Altogether it seems to be time for the white races to take a fresh
survey of the whole situation, and to recognise that, in the changed
conditions, the old haughty and dictatorial attitude stands in need of
modification."</p></div>

 Lest it may appear that I am under-rating the speed with which
evolutionary forces have operated among the European races during
the last few centuries, I venture to quote the words of one whose
opinion is likely to be listened to with respect, and who was the last
man to minimise the significance of the conquests made by science.
"There can be no doubt that vast changes have taken place in English
civilisation since the reign of the Tudors. But I am not aware of
a particle of evidence in favour of the conclusion that this evolutionary
process has been accompanied by any modification of the physical
or the mental characters of the men who have been the subjects of it.
I have not met with any grounds for suspecting that the average
Englishmen of to-day are sensibly different from those that Shakespeare
knew and drew.... In my belief the innate qualities, physical,
intellectual and moral, of our nation have remained substantially the
same for the last four or five centuries" (T. H. Huxley, <cite>Prolegomena
to Evolution and Ethics</cite>).</p></div>

 A few years ago a certain Chinese magistrate in a district very
near Weihaiwei was much disgusted, on arriving at his post, to find
that the opportunities for "squeeze" were so severely limited that
he was likely to remain a poor man. On his own responsibility he
decided to tap a new source of revenue, and issued a proclamation
to the necessary effect. In a few days the populace was up in arms, the
magistrate's official residence was pulled to pieces (it is still almost a
ruin), and he was himself a disgraced fugitive.</p></div>
